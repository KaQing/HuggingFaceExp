"Il y a bien des scènes ridicules jouées par Rosanna Arquette lors de ses discussions avec les personnes de l'au-delà sous une musique d'orgue à l’américaine. Elle a des visions du futur, également et les personnes dans l'assistance sont bien choisies pour des parodies. On voit bien que les acteurs sont amateurs et que la mise en scène est classique. Le déroulé manque d'intérêt et ma plupart des dialogues sont conventionnels, surtout chez la medium. Je n'ai pas aimé, d'autant que, plus récent, il y a ""L'illusionniste"" de Neil Burger avec Edward Norton qui est beaucoup, beaucoup mieux, surtout sur la partie medium et son explication.",negative,fr

"Recently bought what turned out to be a very poor quality 32 inch Acer monitor that developed a fault. As per other retail web sites I tried to leave a review on the Argos web site against the monitor highlighting my issues. Argos web site would not let me do so thus giving the potential purchaser, myself included originally, that this monitor was great as per the very positive reviews on there.

"I keep going back to Papago, hoping my dining experience will change. Mainly because I LOVE the Orange Blossom and their pizza.\n\nEach time is the same. I walk in and sit down, wait, then wait some more. Even though the place is filled, the wait staff can be found standing and talking to each other behind the bar. I witness the people next to us go to the bar for a beer because they were tired of waiting for someone to take their order. Last time I checked, this place was not self-serve. \n\nJust last week my husband and I decided to try Papago one last time. This time our strategy was to sit at the bar to avoid waiting for someone to take our order. The bartender behind the bar was nice. He served our drinks quickly. \n\nHowever, what we observed while we sat at the bar made me never want to step foot in this establishment again. The bartender was arguing with a young waitress about food that was sitting in the kitchen. Her response, \""I didn't know where it went so I left it there.\"" The place is small, I'm sure she could have figured it out. There was another girl working that must have been her buddy. The bartender, who I assume was in charge, was getting on them (probably for being worthless). They were rolling their eyes when he looked away and had bad attitudes. While sitting at the bar, we watched at least ten customers have to come up and order their drink. While the waitresses stood talking and complaining. \n\nI told my husband, \""If I owned this place and saw the slow, poor service, along with how many customers had to go to the bar for service, I would be embarrassed!\"" Come to find out, the owner had been sitting behind us the entire night. It amazes me how he could be in his own restaurant and be completely oblivious to the poor customer service. \n\nI would much rather go out of my way and go to Four Peaks. Maybe one day Papago Brewery will hire a pleasant, efficient wait staff.",negative,en

"I love the Biltmore's lobby, the Rendezvous Court, and Smeraldi's Restaurant. The Old World murals, gorgeous high ceilings with artistic wood and plaster work, and the traditional furnishings qualify this downtown Los Angeles gem as one of the world's great historic hotels.
Having said that, I'm not sure I would stay there again. The night I checked in I couldn't make the TV work and called reception. They said they'd sent an engineer, but then called back to say it was the cable company's fault and they couldn't do anything about it. They were waiting for the cable company's visit ""tomorrow.""
I also noticed some fairly obvious deferred maintainance in the room. For instance, the ornamental drape over the bed was held together by a plastic twist tie because the bracket intended for this purpose was broken. I also learned that none of the rooms in the hotel come with mini-fridges, and the in-room safe was useless because it was located on a high shelf in the closet that I could barely reach. The hotel does not have a spa, but does have a fitness center and an indoor pool.
I should also mention that my room was on the more expensive Club Floor, but learned that the Club Lounge closes for several hours during the day and at 8pm every night. The staff in the Lounge were not helpful in anyway. The lounge offers one computer with Internet access, continental breakfast, and evening hors d'oevres.
I mentioned to two different staff members that my room lacked a robe, slippers, and coffee maker and both of them told me to ""call housekeeping."" I've traveled enough to know that in a hotel with an attentive staff, they would have taken care of it themselves.
Valet parking is $40 a day, which seems excessive, but really it was the staff attitude and the deferred maintainance that bothered me the most. Anyone who decides to stay here should know that room sizes vary widely. I saw a ""standard room"" on a lower floor that was twice the size of mine on the Club Floor (although it had the same small bathroom). I recommend specifying at the time of booking that you'd like one of the spacious rooms - whether Club Floor or Standard.
The beds were very comfortable and the bed linens were high quality. The location is also convenient for attending events at the Walt Disney Concert Hall and the Music Centre. I'm just sorry that staff attitude was so poor.
I wouldn't recommend the hotel to a friend for an overnight stay, but will continue to keep it on my list of must-see places in L. A. and no doubt will return for a meal or afternoon tea.",positive,en

"The room was ok, clean and comfortable and also $370 for the cheapest one. Looks like a 1 bedroom luxury apt, however, you touch anything in that room and there goes at least $30 from your card, even if it's just a bottle of water and even if you tell them not to charge you before they make a contact. So, one minus there.

Well, I'm 32 and I'm an IT professional. You'd figure, a guy like me can figure out the whole navigations system in BMW 6 series in less than 10 minutes, but here I'm trying to figure out how to turn on the hot water. So I gave up after almost a minute of freezing my but there.
Second minus.
Now I'm trying to reach them to figure out why did they charge me $50 for, and naturally, you won't get live person. You have to leave a message. Nice try. People usually give up when they have to leave a message for something like this. Well, not me.

My favourite dish is the meatballs and mash potatoes and dessert goes to their apple strudel.

"My daughter and I stayed for one night on a recent trip to visit Northeastern. In reading the reviews, I asked for a room on the back side of the hotel to avoid the noise of Huntington Ave. That was request was met, but the hotel overall is very noisy with thin walls and doors. As we were settling in we could hear a couple of little kids next door clearly singing ""Take Me Out to the Ball Game"", and then heard the front desk staff knocking on someone's door at 3am. There were a couple of busloads of what looked like middle-school aged kids who were staying at the hotel, but mercifully, they were on the other side of the hotel.
The room was large, beds comfy, and bathroom clean with a good shower. Coffee maker in the room was good too. Parking convenient and relatively inexpensive for Boston.
So, while the location and rate were great, I'm not sure I'd risk staying again for fear that we might have more noisy neighbors than we had this time around. I noticed on their ""welcome board"" that they had several school groups coming - so perhaps worth checking before you book.",neutral,en

There is a Safeway right across the street, which made things very convenient to buy microwavable dinners and having an affordable meal.

The rooms division manager and operations manager were both very friendly and accommodating but moving one from a dirty room to the next dirty room does unfortunately not solve the real problem does it?

The entire experience is a sad one. A typical case of how much money can we milk out of this building without providing any service and the bare bone essentials.

"I also booked this hotel based on previous reviews. Either the reviewers have different standards, or management went downhill since. The room was filthy. Hair on the sheets and the sink. Mold in the bathroom. The pull out bed was so filthy (crumbs, peanuts, pieces of tortilla chips...) that we gave up on it, also because the mattress was thinner than the pillows. How is someone supposed to sleep on that mattress? Beats me. We ended up using an air mattress we had in the car.
Service was below average. The young woman who checked me was not even listening to my questions, the man who checked me out seemed not to know what he was doing. Only one woman seemed to have a notion of ""customer service,"" and was prompt and helpful when our room key stopped working.
The water pressure was adequate, but the shower curtain is wafer thin and it's easy to flood the bathroom floor. The bathroom door did not lock.
Last but not least, the boors above. A family with kids whose parents apparently did not believe in controlling the little lovelies, who as a result screamed and stomped most of the night. I cannot blame the hotel for the rudeness of certain American families, but be forewarned that this is the crowd that hangs out at Best Western. Needless to say, we will NOT be back.",negative,en

"Met friends on a Saturday evening after seeing a show at the Benedum.\n\nInterior was nice, exposed brick walls, deep red walls, pictures of NOLA, fleur de lis, Seated right away.\n\nFried Green Tomatoes. Looking at the menu description now, I realize I should have figured out these would be deep fried because the description says 'abita batter' but at the time, I was very disappointed because in my experience, fried green tomatoes are not dipped in batter and deep fried. They are coated in bread crumbs/cornmeal/flour and fried in some oil/bacon fat/butter in a skillet. I've always had breaded fried tomatoes, not battered & deep fried. I thought this dish was just OK, kind of disappointing. I am still so very much in love with fried green tomatoes after our honeymoon in the south and I get very excited when I see them on a menu, but these were a letdown for me. Plus, they were incredibly filling. I didn't have much room for my meal.\n\nCrispy Fried Alligator: I didn't try any. Two in our group had the alligator bites and enjoyed them, but they both noted that pretty much anything would taste good coasted in the slightly spicy breading and deep fried the served with the spicy aioli. \n\nCrab Bisque: I expected a light pink kind of color, not this dark red-brown color. G liked it, said it was spicier (more heat) than he expected, it was good, but that overall, he prefers the creamier, lighter colored versions. \n\nSeafood Jambalaya: G liked it but didn't love it. The scallops were cooked nicely, but the chicken was dry and tough. \n\nShrimp & Grits: I didn't really like this version. There were only seven shrimp and they were not especially large shrimp.There were a lot of bacon bits. The grits were nice and creamy. But I could swear our server mentioned that the barbecue like sauce was more sweet than hot and while I am a spice wimp, I found there to be just too much heat for my liking. I drank all my iced tea and some water, which rarely if ever happens, and when it does, it's because something is too hot for me or too salty. \n\nBeignets: They are very liberally coated in powdered sugar. That means I ended up covered in powdered sugar, even after shaking a bunch of it off. They also were served with three scoops of ice cream (coffee, cherry, and carrot). I don't know if I was just too full or if I found the beignets a bit bland or a bit heavy, but I ended up enjoying the ice cream much more than the beignets. Except for that carrot ice cream - interesting idea and I could taste a bit of cinnamon, I think, in the tiny taste I tried, but overall not a flavor I would suggest. The coffee ice cream was my favorite and everyone else thought the cherry was the best. \n\nOf the four of us, three of us had never before dined at NOLA. I had the impression from a previous restaurant conversation that the person who had dined there before thought it was just OK but was willing to return so the rest of us could try it. After dining there, I can see why that person thought it was just OK.\n\nWhile we were seated right away, a few minutes before our 5:45 pm reservation, it took a while for our server to make an appearance and we did not get out of there until 8 pm. R&S had to ask for their check when dessert was served to make sure they had enough time to get to the show at 8 pm. They rushed through dessert and left while we lingered a bit over dessert. Maybe it was poor planning on our part, but we were surprised at the pace of the service. \n\nOur server was fine. He offered lots of suggestions/opinions on several menu options. I thought that was nice, although it seemed to take quite a while, and others felt it was too much and unnecessary.\n\nNothing was glaringly awful, well maybe the slow service which was kind of annoying, the food was all just sort of fine or kind of disappointing, but for what we spent ($100+ after tax & tip, no alcohol) it was very disappointing. We can easily name other places where we like the food more and will spend less, and so for that reason, I have to say I doubt we will ever return, but it's possible after we exhaust the other post-show dining options and see where everything rates, but with only two shows left and us not sure if we will renew for the next season...",negative,en

"While I appreciate the addition of a sushi restaurant out here in Goodyear, I must say that I'd just rather drive to Westgate and eat at Be Sushi if I want sushi. \n\nMy husband and I dropped in for a quick dinner the other day before grocery shopping. He can't eat much fish at all, so he ordered some gyoza and a tempura shrimp roll. He enjoyed his food, but I tasted the gyoza and it was more deep fried than pan fried, which I did not like. \n\nI had the spicy tuna roll and the veggie tempura. The tuna roll was fine - not bad, but not notably good. The tempura was good, and I was surprised (and pleased) to find eggplant among the veggie-ness.\n\nThe water they served us was horrendous. I generally just like water with sushi, unless I am drinking a beer (which I wasn't in the mood for that night). I had to order an iced-tea to get the horrible taste of the water out of my mouth.\n\nThe only other criticism I have for the place is that their servingware looks like, well, hand-me-downs. I kept thinking, 'Didn't this place just recently open?' It had that \""hole-in-the-wall\"" feel inside that is only quaint to me when the place A) has been around forever and B) is the most delicious thing ever. \n\nSo, to quote Yelp, \""Meh.

It is a bit of a maze, but this makes the property very fun to explore and if you are stair adverse you can easily navigate the property by elevator. We stayed in building 6 in room #641 top floor at the end of the building, nice size room. The room was dated but the bed was comfortable. Microwave, refrigerator and coffee maker are nice amenities. There was a sitting area with a chair and a small, uncomfortable couch. The carpet at minimum could use a good cleaning, but the rooms really need updating. If you only plan on using the room to crash after a great day of sightseeing this hotel is perfect.",negative,en

"This is by far my favorite buffet place in town. The other legendary buffet places were no longer in service when I moved here some time ago. But I am happy we have the Journey Sushi now =)\n\nOther reviews have pointed out specifically the pricing and types of food available down to every detail. So I thought I'd list down a couple of my favorites. Coming from Asia, I have tried many different types of food, and I mean A LOT. Which was why I was pleasantly surprised to see that they have raw oysters and shrimps on ice. And sashimi platter too. I remember seeing salmon, tuna, hibachi, octopus sashimi to name a few. The baby clams, crabs and lobsters are really good too. \n\nBy now it is pretty apparent I am a huge seafood fan. But in addition, I also love their tepanyaki (stir-fry) bar. You get to choose the items you like and the chef will stir-fry them for you on the spot. On certain days you get marinated beef ribs at the bar, which are awesome. \n\nThe popular items do go very fast, so keep an eye for your favorites and get it fast, otherwise it will take a while before they re-stock, especially on busy times of the day.\nThey do have a large seating area with an additional room, so definitely the place to go if you have a large group. Great for gatherings and such. \n\nThe location is out on the East side, not the most convenient for me who lives out on the West side and work on campus. But it's great selection of food and good quality draw me here regardless so that says quite a lot about the place =)",neutral,en

Room was immpeccably clean and had a very large bed. There were nice finishing touches which included egyptian cotton sheets and chocolates on the pillow every evening. Room was well equipped with fully stocked mini bar and nice toiletries in the bathroom.
Hotel facilities were also very good. Dinner in the restaurant was nice but a little overpriced for what we got. The roof top bar is just fantastic with an amazing view of the Empire State Building - this is a must after a long day sightseeing or shopping.

I did not have to wait long in line. As soon as I walked in I was greeted and directed to the area where my movie was playing. Before I went in I grabbed some goodies from the snack bar. The snack bar was well staffed with friendly employees. My popcorn was fresh and my beverage was a nice cool drink. The condiment table was filled with popcorn toppings, butter, salt, pepper, napkins and other goodies to go with food ordered. This area was clean. The room I saw my movie in was clean as well. The floors were swept with no trash anywhere in sight. The room temperature was perfect and the sound quality was nice. The theater was cozy. I am happy that I gave this location a try.",neutral,en

"I LOVE the Aria and especially the guest rooms! The best features of the gorgeous rooms include:\n\n- most comfortable bed I have ever slept in with the most amazing pillows too; I really need to call the hotel to ask them where I can buy my own!\n- great technology that allowed us to control all the lights, and the curtains, and the room temperature, music, and even the \""do not disturb\"" light from a touch screen remote beside the bed\n- coolest shower/bath set-up ever - the bath tub was within the big square glass shower which was fun to play in and create an \""infinity bath!\""\n- when we ordered champagne to our room, they also suggested chocolate covered strawberries which were delicious!\n\nAlso, the hotels restaurants were great. There are lots of super options though they are a little pricey. We loved Jean Georges, the Patisserie, and Lemongrass (basically everywhere we tried!) and the others all looked good too.\n\nThe colors of the casino are a bit gloomy with a lot of brown and the fact that the Craps table took a lot of money from us made it feel even gloomier. The dealers did not seem to be Vegas's \""A Team\"" either... I'd rather go elsewhere to gamble but here to stay!!!\n\nThe entrance and waterfall are gorgeous too - you should check out City Center even if you are not staying there!",positive,en

"We had low expectations to this hotel, all we wanted was a place to sleep and shower between our hectic schedule, we only had a couple of days in NYC.

Except from that, we enjoyed our stay in this hotel. The staff was helpful, and our room was cleaned every day. When we needed another blanket, we got it right away. There was a little smell in the room, but it didn't bother us.

Starters crabcakes must of been out of freezer since it took like 5 minutes from the order to get in the table and it tasted like chicken nuggets.. Main course, chicken and cashew nuts, did not taste like anything, not spicy or nothing and vegetables were too raw. In the beginning when we asked for water for the drink with out beers the waitress first forgot then and then when I asked again he brought us tap water in a glass. We had to ask if it was tap water and he said yes and asked then if we wanted bottled water.

I couldn't even watch 30 minutes of this crap, I didn't laugh, chuckle, or even smirk at this movie, actually the only time I smirked was when I saw how horrid this movie was. I could not believe how hard he tried to make the viewers laugh in this movie...and it didn't work once. Although from seeing the horribly awful camera angles and hearing the disgusting script I realized why I had never heard of this movie,...because it sucks more than anything has ever sucked before.

"I chose this hotel purely based on the Tripadvisor reviews, and I'm so glad I did! It made our 8th Anniversary Trip perfect.
This is one of the best hotel experiences we've had in a long, long time. The lobby and room were beautiful. The staff were always friendly and accomodating, from the front desk to valet parkers to food servers. All were so nice! The breakfast buffet (included in room) was great (eggs, sausage, biscuts, cereal, pastries, fruit, you name it). The location was fantastic.
Our room had a king bed with jacuzzi tub for two. It was spotlessly clean, nicely decorated, had free wi-fi access, a 37"" LCD tv, great A/C which you control, a huge jacuzzi tub which we loved, a stall shower, everything you could need. You can request an extra hour at check-out, which we did, for free. Our cool old fashioned looking bank door was awesome as well. We also never heard noise from other rooms. I couldn't not find a single fault with the room, and I'm picky about things! We loved the view from our 19th floor room (as well as the views from the observation deck and pool deck.)
There are two pools, both with jacuzzis. One indoor and one outdoor on the roof. If I were forced to find something wrong, the pools were on the smaller size. But, if having a huge pool was your priority, you probably wouldn't book anywhere in the Riverwalk area anyway. It was so nice to cool down in the roof top pool after a long hot day of walking.

"When arriving at Holiday Inn we pulled up in the drive way and waited about 10 minutes to finally figure out that they don't offer valet service. You have to check in first so you can get a parking stub. The room was standard but nice to have a option of ""firm"" or ""soft"" pillows. They do offer Bath & Body Works toiletries instead of the cheapy stuff. The room 1703 has a view of Van Ness. The bathroom itself is very basic and needs a remodel. The baggage clerk downstairs was nice and gave us help with accessing the nearest bus stop and telling us alternative routes to getting to Pier 39/Fisherman's Wharf. The 47 bus is the cheapest at $2 per passenger. The room was basic with no frills but a plus is that is was quiet on that floor. I would prefer something a bit nicer but it is easy access to the Opera and Govt. buildings",neutral,en

"My husband, son and I spent a week at this resort (8/25/2012 - 8/31/2012). Our room had a wonderful garden and bay view but upon check in we noticed that the security locks on the door entering the room and the door connecting to the room next door were both broken. The sliding door to the balcony was difficult to open. I called the front desk to let them know that I did not feel very secure staying in a room with two broken security locks. The front desk offered to switch our room or to send someone to repair the locks. We opted for the second choice as we really liked the view. A nice gentleman showed up about an hour later . . .he replaced the lock on the door to the adjoining room and tightened the lock on the outer door. He also attempted to fix the sliding door (slight improvement but not great ...)
We did wonder what happened in this room prior to our visit . . . did someone try to break into the room (while someone was in the room with the security lock on) ? was there a fight between guests staying in the connecting rooms?
Our room was quite clean, however, our balcony was dirty, paint was peeling, and there was bird poop on the railing. The balcony was a very nice size but the furniture seemed inadequate compared to the size as there were only two small tall chairs and a very small tall table.
You were supposed to have to enter your room key into the entry door to our building in order to gain access but the entry door was never closed properly and when it was closed . . .it never seemed to lock. Anyone could walk into the building . . . room key or not. The entry door area had a weird smell the entire week and there was a section of the wall that looked very dirty. The hallway leading to our room had lots of very dirty windows overlooking the adult retreat area (a big turnoff!) . . . the windows were full of dirt and cobwebs. The day we checked in . . .I noticed two dirty wine glasses were sitting on the window sill in the hallway outside our door . . .it took hotel staff about 3 days before they were picked up from the window sill.
What is the deal with the parking fee? We were charged a daily parking fee . . .however it seemed that anyone not staying at the hotel could have parked in the hotel parking lot for free as no one ever checked to see if cars had a parking permit. (Charge your guests to park but allow anyone else to park for free ??? ) If you are going to charge for parking . .. you should check cars for parking permits!! Many evenings . . .we had trouble finding a parking spot near our building.
Pool area was very nice but with had to wonder how clean the pool water was as we saw paper napkins floating in the pool and about a half dozen ducks swimming in the pool. Ordered two Pina Coladas from the bar (Alfresco's) and they were terrible (tasted like a water slushy with a dash of rum, pineapple and coconut). I felt bad for the bartender as it was very obvious that he was overwhelmed as it seemed that he was the only bartender to handle the holiday weekend crowd. (You would think a Hilton would have planned better !)
We enjoyed the coffee shop (oatmeal, bear claws and coffee for breakfast). We also enjoyed breakfast at Aqua. We chose to eat dinner at Aqua our last night for the convenience. Dinner was overpriced. My son had the pork chops which were very good. I had the chicken and my husband had the steak which were just okay. We did enjoy the live singer/guitar player during our dinner.
We enjoyed the dive in movie night (complimentary popcorn was a nice touch!). We also enjoyed family smore's night on the beach (the singers/guitar player was also really nice touch!)

"Everything you are looking for in a decent park!\n\nThe layout of this place is a good design. On one end you have a big parking lot. This section is where the kids playground and some covered areas complete with tables, benches, and barbeque grills. Also there is a large soccer field and tennis court as well, not ti mention several basketball courts.\n\nIn the middle of the park you have a single stand up building for your restrooms which I gotta say when I used it that it was nice and clean. \n\nJust past that are a couple of baseball fields that are nicely maintained. Also there is another parking lot next to that as well so you don't have park on the other side and don't have to walk as far.\n\nAll through out the park there are benches and drinking fountains which to me means a lot especially on those hot triple digit summer days. The paths are nice and wide enough for joggers, bikers, and for walking your dog.",positive,en

"Mỗi phần của cuốn sách đều được bắt đầu bằng những câu chuyện do Đại đức từng trải qua.

Có lẽ đến đây nhiều bạn sẽ thắc mắc sống hiền lành cũng là một điều sai sao? Sống hiền không sai nhưng sống mà cứ thuận theo ý kiến người khác để vừa lòng họ, không dám nói lên ý kiến của mình, kìm nén cảm xúc của mình để rồi đôi khi ta cảm thấy oan ức, khốn khổ và tự công kích chính bản thân mình. Để thay đổi, chúng ta cần phải sống hiền lành với bản thân mình trước khi hiền lành với người khác, đừng ngần ngại bộc lộ suy nghĩ và cảm xúc của mình với đối phương, đừng sợ việc đó sẽ khiến đối phương ghét bạn vì có lẽ họ cũng muốn biết cảm nhận của bạn là như thế nào đấy.",positive,vi

"I cannot believe I haven't reviewed this place! I have been here a handful of times and each time it has been consistently good. My favorite item is the 24 K curry, which is a spicy green curry that features some delicious veggies (japanese eggplant that is melt in your mouth (probably the best eggplant I've ever had... I don't typically like eggplant), squash, and green beans). I usually add chicken and have more than enough food for two meals. Wild Thaiger has decent specials on some nights of the week for drinks (Mondays feature 5$ martinis). My only complaint about the Thaiger is that, unlike other Thai restaurants, they do not allow you to choose your spiciness level. I understand that some dishes may be better spicy or mild, but I would like to have the option available. I would say that Wild Thaiger is the best Thai food I have had in the downtown area and would recommend it.",neutral,en

"As a child, I spent my summers in NYC, and now as an adult, I go back every chance I get. This was the fisrt time I had stayed in this hotel, and it exeeded my expectations. i went up for new years and stayed with a good freind on the 31st, then we went here for the 1st. The hotel was easy to find and right in midtown. The building is beatifull, and I like how simplistic the decor was. I had more guests then originally planned, and wanted to pay for extra cots, but they upgraded our room with no addtuional charge. As a college student paying out of pocket, this was a big deal! We were given our key, and took the elavator to our room, where we found 2 queen sized beds, a medium sized bathroom, a large flat screen tv, and ample space to put away our belongings. The room was very clean, and smelled like fresh laundry. The beds were so comfy, I slept like a baby! There was plenty of towels/shampoo/conditioner/soap. They provide Aveda products, so they don't give you the cheap stuff. At check out(after forcing ourselves out of those comfy beds) we were able to check in our bags free of charge to pick up that day so we did not have to lug them around town with us. They provide coffee and hot chocolate and tea for free in the lobby. I was hoping they had the New York Tiems available, but they had the New York post, possibly thier only flaw. The service was great. The staff was extremely helpfull and freindly. We got free biscotti with our cofee while talking with one of the staff members about New Years, and it was good. I will definatley reccomend this to anyone on a budget. I look forward to going back in June. Happy new year!",positive,en

(Mild spoilers) My heart is so full after reading this book. Johan is utterly sweet, and I love the way he takes responsibility for his mistakes and refuses to let Nya placate him. Nya's relationship with her father is heartwrenching. The book clearly shows how his lies and manipulation have had a lasting effect on her. Johan of course isn't fooling anybody with his pretense that he doesn't have feelings for Nya. He keeps telling her ""as you wish"" in his native tongue, and we all know what that means. Then there's Lukas. Non-binary heir to the throne, trying to find their place in the world.

"Like most on here I too was apprehensive about my stay at the Roosevelt. I'm pleased to say, that in part, my apprehensions did not fully come to fruition. As ever I'll start with the positives. The lobby, bar area and all other communal areas of the hotel were immaculate and the 1930s decor was stunning in my opinion, here the hotel is befitting of it's mantra ""the grand old dame"". Clearly the makers of Gossip Girl agreed, they were filming at the hotel during my stay. The food was good too, my steak earned it's $25 price tag I'd say. The maid service was excellent, each day I returned to my room to find my bed made with fresh towels in the bathroom, the cleaning it's self was to high standard with all the debrief from my previous day's exploits in and around Manhattan readily taken care of. The location of the hotel is another positive, if you want to walk or take the Subway most of the key attractions of this great city are within easy reach of the Roosevelt. Now about the room, 852, it was clean, a good size and contained two comfortable double beds. However, it is true to say that there were some noticeable minor aesthetic defects though certainly not enough to warrant any great concern, the bathroom however, whilst being clean and fully functional was in need of refurbishment. Small pockets of mold had developed around the bath with the some of the enamel worn away on the bath it's self. In all the bathroom had a rather dated feel to it though I should stress that this again is no great cause for concern. We are talking minor defects here, similar to those I've encountered in 4 and 5 star hotels. My experience of the hotel bar was over all a little less then satisfactory, service was slow, here I do not blame the bar staff, the fact is on the nights in question there simply wasn't enough staff on to cope with demand. In all certainly not the horror hotel some would have you believe, I enjoyed my stay and would happily return. A solid 3 star hotel that has the potential to strive for better things. If you're thinking of staying at the Roosevelt I have some advice for you. 1) Don't pay $14 per day for Internet access. Every Starbucks and McDonald's in Manhattan provides free wireless Internet access, simply accept the terms and conditions and you're online. There is at least three Starbucks and one McDonald's with two minutes walk of the hotel. 2) If you're a Steak fan you must visit Morton's Steak House, a minutes walk away on the same street (45th Street) Morton's provides probably the best Steak in the world, I cannot describe how good this restaurant is. If you have the cash to spare, it is pricey, you must go. 3) Visit the Highline. The Highline is an old elevated rail road that snakes it's way throughout the lower middle half of Manhattan and beyond. Long since disused it has been converted into public gardens with much of the old rail infrastructure left in place, it truly is a unique, beautiful public space that provides great views of the city and a great place to unwind. Entrance can be found on 23rd Street, and the best part, it's completely free. 4) For breakfast lunch or dinner try the New York Luncheonette, situated on 50th Street close to the junction with 3rd Avenue it's about a five minute walk from the hotel. The locals love it and so will you.",neutral,en
"Great location, great price! The hotel is one of the closest to the airport and it's right in the middle of the action. The beds are comfortable and you can spend a bit more for a larger room with two sinks and a large soaker tub and separate shower. Internet is a bit pricey at $13.99/day. \n\nThere is a shopping mall attached complete with two ABC Liquor/Convenience stores (reasonably priced) as well as H&M, Bath and Body Works, and a few less expensive dining options. The restaurants in the hotel itself are good, however they're not the most affordable. This is common among the luxury hotels on the strip.",neutral,en

"First of all sorry for my English that is not very good. I and my wife went to a trip to west USA and Canada for 37 days. In this wonderful trip we accommodated 27 hotels and motels, three of them were booked in advance by our travel agent. For the Renoir hotel we paid for 3 nights $450. I am sorry to state that Renoir hotel was the worst of all the hotels we have been at.
As many travelers mentioned there are many homeless people near the hotel. Not very pleasant but bearable.
The real bad thing was the room. A very little dense room with 2 single narrow beds with very hard mattresses. There was only one ramshackle chair in the room, it was dangerous to sit on it. Room without air conditioner and without possibility to open a window. Tiny, old bathroom disgusting to enter. Lack a toilet paper and only one towel for each of us. We asked on possibility of connection to Internet and were told that there are two positions in the lobby by payment. We agreed to pay but all our efforts and the reception staff to connect did not succeed. Concerning the parking, it is acceptable to pay about $30 for one day and we agreed to pay it.
Since the room was so terrible and Although we already paid $450 (plus tax), we had no choice but to search another hotel, and indeed very soon we found an excellent hotel not very far away from the Renoir hotel in a calm and pleasant environment. We returned to hotel Renoir and requested not to charge us for the half hour in which the car parked in the parking lot. The reception clerk tried to credit us but since he didn't know how to do it, he phoned the manager of the hotel that explained him how to do it. We were promised that we will not be debited for the half hour (time of the parking for that day).
When arriving back to our country we were surprised to find that our visa account was debited despite the promise.
To conclude, my recommendation is not to stay in this hotel.",negative,en

The entertainment system is fantastic, and you get to watch it on a beautifully large screen, and have the use of a console to control the screen.
All the food provided was the best I've had on a plane, the flight attendants keep your glass topped up whenever you ask for a refill, and make sure you are well hydrated.

"Short version: every health care professional in the country should be required to tour this place to see how it's done.\n\nLong version: Facing a possible serious health condition I grew tired of waiting for my primary to refer me to a specialist and called Mayo. They accepted my insurance (United Healthcare) and scheduled an appt within a week.\n\nLeading up to my appointment I received 3 calls - preregistration they call it - each designed to make my first visit as fast and easy as possible.\n\nFor my first appt they actually had me in early. I had a lengthy discussion with a cardiologist named Dr. Click, who was professional, knowledgeable, genuinely interested and in no rush to just get me in and out. He scheduled three more appointments and within 15 minutes I had a printed itinerary. The first was bloodwork. Down one floor where I waited less than 15 minutes before I was in and done. The 2nd and 3rd were two days later and again I was admitted early.\n\nEvery single person I encountered there (10+) was pleasant and professional. Each confirmed my name and birth date to make sure I was who they thought I was...comforting to say the least.\n\nAfter all of the tests were done I met with the cardiologist again and he went to great lengths to explain every detail to me, answer my questions and give his advice. At no point did I feel rushed or like I was just a number (or a payment on a summer home.)\n\nThe facility is about an hour from Central Phoenix but well worth the drive. For out-of-towners they have a hotel next door. I'd highly recommend Mayo to anyone and would probably fly family members out the next time the need arises.",positive,en

"Here is what disappointed me about the Austin Hilton: Small room, dowdy furniture (more like a Holiday Inn along the highway), small bathroom, extra fee for internet service in the room, very small space in hotel lobby to access free wireless internet service, fee for using exercise room (although, I admit, I didn't have to pay because I am a member of Hilton Honors with silver status). For the price I paid, the value was just not there. To be fair, not all was bad. The mattress was very comfortable and the room was kept clean. I also did not hear much hallway noise. There is a very nice cafe in the lobby (Starbucks type, but not a Starbucks although the coffee is Starbucks) with a very nice atmosphere. The location is fine for downtown business travelers, or, if you are so inclined to want to go to a lot of bars on 6th St. I guess my biggest gripe is the value for the money.

"I saw Bandit Queen in 2005, over a decade after it was made amidst widespread controversy in India. The language, the stark treatment and the natural acting (by a relatively unknown cast for that time) might have been even more shocking at that time for an Indian populace more familiar with fantasy cinema. The film, the cast, and Shekhar Kapoor, deserve accolades for the breakthrough effort.The plot is not very different from a typical revenge drama made in various forms in India. In fact, there have been several fictional accounts of this particular story itself. The reason why this stands out is that it's supposed to be a first person account of someone who actually went through all this, and a lot else that doesn't find place on the screen, and survived to tell the tale. Survived long enough to see her story made into a movie at least. Phoolan Devi didn't live very long after being released from prison in 1994.The film scores on several counts. The cinematography is brilliant. The music is apt. The cast, many of whom became more familiar names later, is very good. But the screenplay is patchy. Things move too fast and in jerks at times. It's understandable though, because there are just too many strands that need to be tied together to make it all cohesive. Or maybe I felt that because I have read Mala Sen's book, which is a more detailed and better, though obviously not as shocking as the visual, account of Phoolan Devi's travails, and which is purported to be one of the main sources for the film.There are some factual ambiguities too. According to Phoolan Devi, she wasn't present when the Behmai massacre took place, and despite claiming to be the dictated account of Phoolan herself, she is shown to participate, and in fact initiate, the massacre. Then the final scene where Phoolan surrenders shows her touching the feet of the Chief Minister, while in reality she had surrendered to a portrait of Mahatma Gandhi. Symbolic value only, but shows that Phoolan didn't want to show servitude to a living, ordinary person. It would have been nice to show the Chief Minister to have some resemblance to Arjun Singh, who many remember was the CM of Madhya Pradesh then.But these are small chinks in this eminently well-made movie, a rare gem to come out from the mainstream Indian film industry, made by a man who before this was known best for the ultimate masala movie of the late 80s - Mr India.",positive,en

"The Allerton's only advantage; LOCATION. It is central to everything and smack dab in the middle of all the hustle and bustle of Michigan Ave. I've stayed here several times and find it average on all accounts. Just love the location; dont expect much from this hotel.
Until my recent experience, I had never encountered problems with this hotel.
The woman, who checked us in one evening, was very rude and did not offer any room upgrade alternatives (i.e., upgrading to a king suite) to accomodate 3 adults when I discussed my initial needs. Instead, she was standoffish, short, and unhelpful, providing us with keys to room that did not fit our needs with helping to identify a fitting solution. Upon walking into the room, we realized how small it was and called down to the front desk to ask for other options from another woman, which the woman in the beginning should have suggested to us before hauling all of our luggage upstairs and having to come back down. I was glad we got to upgrade for an additional $35/night, which is no problem. My other complaints was that Valet service was not available when I arrived and we had to double-park and go inside to get somebody to assist us. The elevators are also very small.
I have been charged an additional fees on my debit card; I have called the front desk and been fowarded to the accounting center several times where I have left only 2 voicemails requesting that someone call me back. I am dissapointed and frustrated with the level of service provided by this hotel, beginning from check-in to even after the hotel stay- which I am still dealing with a week after my check-out date. No one has contacted me from the hotel yet.
For the level of dissatisfaction I have experienced, I do not plan to use this hotel in the future and nor will I recommend it to anyone else.",negative,en

"It deeply disturbs me that Subway has become the go-to sub shop around the states. Apparently when the oil shortage started there was also a cold cuts bandit that held Subway hostage and now you're only allowed 3 slices of meat on your mediocre roll and if you'd like the blandness toasted, they can do that now too, oh joy. \n\nI would vote for Capriotti's to take over all Subways but I'd most likely gain 20 pounds from eating a sub everyday for the rest of my life. A foot long a day would make any girl happy.\n\nCapriotti's prides itself on freshness, slow cooking and hand pulling their turkey and roast beef at the shop. The three sammys I suggest and love are the grilled italian, the cheese steak, and the signature bobbie. The first 2 are pretty self explanatory, loaded with tons of meat, cheese and veggies and beyond scrumptious. The bobbie however is specific to them and is made of homemade turkey, cranberry sauce, stuffing and mayo. Your first bobbie will have your taste buds dancing and when you stare that sub down like Joey on Friends you'll never be the same. Every Subway you pass from that moment on will look like the talentless redheaded stepchild of the sub world.\n\nJust in case you still don't believe me, check out the awards for these hand held wonders: \n <url> They.

"Oh my goodness. This was a real big mess that just couldn't help itself. Jeffrey (Jon Heder) is a 29 year old man still living with his mum (Diane Keaton) and not planning on going anywhere. Until his mother meets a rich businessman named Mert (Jeff Daniels) who she may be getting married to.It would have been an OK movie if Heder didn't play his Jeffrey so annoying, from the very start there is no chance of liking him and it only gets worse and worse. In the end, we are supposed to like him, but there was no reason to as he hadn't changed from the selfish brute that he was at the beginning of the movie.Keaton doesn't look to even be trying and is in horrible form after 2007's Because I Said So. Not to mention the shocking chemistry between Heder and Keaton, and where supposed to believe that their mother and son? The only saving grace is Jeff Daniels and Anna Faris although they don't look very interested either. Apart from a few little smiles, this film really doesn't deserve to be called a comedy simply because there is barely anything to laugh at!

"Viva Las Vegas! I was in Sin City for a business convention. I was there for business, but I managed to have a lot of fun along the way. I LOVE to gamble! A lot of my associates were staying at cheaper hotels, but I don't settle for second best. I enjoy the thrill of gambling. A little too much, hahaha... I really love to bet on sports and for my money (literally), Mandalay Bay has the best sports book in Vegas. My wife (now ex-wife) and I once stayed at MB a year after it opened. It has changed a lot, but it's still just as good as it was then. \n\nI had just a bit of trouble at check-in. The room was not ready on time, so I hung around the casino for a while and ended up losing around $1500 . That is a lot of coin to lose while waiting for your room. It was not a huge deal. When the room was ready, the bellman was terrific in carrying my two very heavy suitcases to my room. \n\nI had a room on an upper floor. The view of the strip was spectacular. A man-made city of lights in the desert! I stared out in wonderment. I almost forgot to unpack, I was so entranced by the beauty of this mysterious city. \n\nThe bed was fit for a king. The entire room made me feel like a sultan of the desert. Nice artwork and color scheme. The bathroom looked nice, but that is where most of my problems with the room took place. I also had a small problem with the television. The first time I used the remote, it wouldn't turn on the TV. I called the front desk and they sent up a nice man to change the batteries. Turns out that there was nothing wrong with the remote. I was just holding it upside down. I felt a little silly, but the man assured me that this happens quite often. \n\nLets talk about the bathroom. A sunken bathtub, a shower stall, and a little television IN THE BATHROOM! Viewable from the throne (toilet). One night, I felt like using the bathtub. It was very relaxing. The problem was the amount of towels. I had previously asked them for extra towels. I usually need around four. I was not able to dry myself off thoroughly. I called from the bathroom and asked them to quickly send me up a few towels (I was still wet). A woman from housekeeping came by with ONE towel. There was one awkward moment when the maid handed it through the door as I tried to cover myself the best I could. \n\nThat was only one problem I encountered with the bathroom. The toilet clogged a few times throughout my stay and I even ran out of toilet paper. Both times, the maintenance staff handled the situations very respectfully. \n\nIf you love to party, you never have to leave MB. Any type of experience you desire: Asian, French, Italian, Mexican, American, and Russian. That week I ate at a bunch of great restaurants: Border Grill, Burger Bar, Charlie Palmer Steak, Citizens Kitchen & Bar, Hussong's Cantina, Bayside Buffet (twice), Noodle Shop, and Rick Moonen's RM Seafood. All great! \n\nI must also say that I have stayed at both the MGM and Luxor in the past, and MB's casino is much better. I played a lot of slots, poker, roulette, craps, etc.... It was a blast. I won some money, lost some money, and was maybe only down around 2K for the week.\n\nToward the end of my week, I booked myself some spa time at Spa Mandalay. I was putting a lot of stress on myself during the week and needed to unwind. I got deep tissue massage and found it unsatisfying. It didn't feel like my tissues were being penetrated enough. I also had a steam wrap (very nice), a Fijian Hot Stone Herbal Scrub, and a Moroccan Hot Stone Ritual (which I still don't quite understand). The whole thing was pretty nice, but I liked the steam wrap the most. \n\nThere is a ton to do and see at Mandalay Bay. The casino, restaurants, and spa were all great. (Forgot to mention the aquarium, great for kids and adults) I guess there is a club scene there as well, but I don't care for any of that. Overall, my stay was wonderful! (On the flight home, I noticed my glands were swollen. This probably didn't have anything to do with my stay)",neutral,en

"This movie is not the scariest of all time, but it is a great example of a campy eighties horror flick -- low budget, no stars, lots of inventive death scenes, and enough nudity to keep the teenagers in their seats. The premise is interesting and fun and the three evil kids play their parts well. A nice starting point for ""Just Say"" Julie Brown exposing her talents early in her career. This film won't be seen by many, but for fans of 80's horror it's a must.",positive,en

"Bette Midler is indescribable in this concert. She gives her all every time she is on stage. Whether we are laughing at her jokes and antics or dabbing our eyes at the strains of one of her tremendous ballads, Bette Midler moves her audience. If you can't see it live (which is the best way to see Bette) then this is the next best thing. An interesting thing to look at is how incredible her voice has changed and matured over the years but never lost its power. Her more ""vocally correct"" version of ""Stay With Me"" never loses anything in spirit from THE ROSE or DIVINE MADNESS, Here it is just more pure and as heartfelt as ever. I will treasure this concert for a very long time.",positive,en

"I gave this film an 10/10 with some reluctance as it's hard to praise something that so haunted and terrified me for years. The sheer menace on the woman in black's face is just pure horror and the accompanying music just worsens the dread. I saw this when it was first on TV when I was 10 and it really did disturb me for years. I'm fascinated by the fact that so many other users have said this too. So many movie reviews go on about how disturbing or terrifying a film might be but you can believe all those who have posted on this board, this really is incredibly powerful stuff. I mean I really like horror films and generally find them quite funny more often than not, but this really is menacing and will probably disturb most people. I haven't seen it since I was 10 and I'm tempted to watch it again but fear I might have some sleepless nights. I can't quite put my finger on what it is exactly, but I think it's something to do with the fact that fear is the Woman's greatest weapon and that we, as viewers, are just as susceptible as we feel the fear so intensely. It's remarkable that other viewers' feelings are so unanimous.I've also seen the stage play, which was an excellent production...but nothing can compare to this.",positive,en

We ordered chicken malai tikka, machli tikka (fish), palak paneer, began masala, kadai murg and masala jhinga. The chicken was really very nice, tender, juicy and very tasty. The fish tikka was too salty and all the curries were overlooked and seemed to be made with the same basic curry. Not very nice and certainly not the best Indian diner we have had around Kuala Lumpur. One more comment, the restaurant is a bit outdated and stuffy (a bit strange because they just renovated the place) and made worse due to the thick carpet which seems a bit unhygienic to us. Not sure if we will return (unfortunately).",negative,en

"I'm a big fan of the aloft brand from SPG because for certain types of trips it gives us exactly what we want and need and no more. I appreciate there are two desks, there is free wifi, there is a fridge in the room, there are healthy, edible snacks available on a 24/7 basis (among other things, like the exercise room and the properties that have a laundromat and the free parking at most).
This particular aloft is a little run down. The bathroom wasn't as crisp and the rooms were way too worn out for such a new property. I know it's an airport hotel and people are passing through but this is a big problem for me in many hotels in Philadelphia, not just here. The bathroom tiles in the shower had already started to settle, making it uncomfortable to stand on. The safe in our room was shut and no one noticed it. The rooms were clean enough but the public areas were not.
The beds were very comfortable, comforters adequate, pillows soft. I am there to sleep, this is important.
I would like to praise the hotel staff for good humor and attentiveness, except for the woman who was working Saturday afternoon. She was decidedly too junior and that was clear from her interactions not just with me but with others. The hotel was booked full due to three different concerts in the area and this is not the time to try out someone new.
Keep in mind that if you are traveling to Philly and stay at this hotel, you do not need a car. The free airport shuttle will connect you to the SEPTA (regional rail) at the airport, which takes you to Center City in 15 minutes. However, there is NOTHING ELSE within walking distance of the hotel, so once you're there, you're stranded if you don't have a car. There are two other SPG properties in the same complex so you could eat at their restaurants if you had to. If you do have a car, this is an excellent option for events at Citizens Bank Park, Lincoln Financial Field, or the arena in the same complex - it's less than 10 minutes' away.",negative,en

"I would stay here again but only because of the location. If the room was not clean I would ask to be moved next time.
The Good:
The location is great - close to all the attractions at or near the wharf. It is an easy walking distance to the ferries for the Alcatraz tours. The area is very safe so you can feel comfortable walking day or night. The lobby is very nice. ALL the staff were very professional and helpful. Always had a hello and a smile even in the pouring rain. There are snacks, sandwiches and drinks available in the lobby for a fairly reasonable price. The beds and pillows were very comfortable. Starbucks coffee for the room :). IHOP just down the street for a cheaper breakfast.
The Not so Good:
The buffet was expensive but I did not go beyond the door. Would take a pretty outstanding hotel buffet to be worth the price. The rooms are far from sound proof. We could CLEARLY hear the people overhead walking. Fortunately they were not up late. The worst was the lack of cleaning in the room. The bed and the counters seemed clean but the floor was very bad. The corners and baseboards were very dusty. I thought I was being picky until we went to leave and my husband checked under the bed. There were pretzels and a bottle cap - obviously had not been vacuumed in quite sometime. There were problems with the elevator and one night only one of the three was running. Parking on site would have been about $60 /day with the taxes. Across the street in the Safeway parking lot it was $30/day but you could not take your car in and out without paying more. No free Wi-Fi in the rooms - cannot figure this one out at all. The hotel across the street offered free Wi-Fi and free parking. In this day and age Wi-Fi should be free in any hotel. I personally feel this is just a gouge and the ""Shertons"" need to look at their Wi-Fi policy. You could get free Wi-Fi in the lobby.",negative,en

"I hate assigned seats at a concert venue. Especially in today's internet purchasing age where all you can do is pray to the music Gods that you are going to get a good seat. You sit patiently in front of your seat, constantly reloading a page as the internet sale begins to make sure you are right there when it starts. You request seats in what must be 10 seconds after the sale started, and the best seats you can get are in the 26th row off center. WTF do you have to do to get a set of the primo seats just fucking once?\n\nThe consolation for seated venues is that it is usually in a great outdoor amphiteater where you can kick back and enjoy your reserved space under the stars. Or its in an art-deco revival theater that is an amazing setting for a show. \n\nBut here at Dodge, there is no consolation prize. Its boxy, boring, and cold. They went to no expense whatsoever to dress up the Dodge or make it an interesting place to see a concert. Its gray, drab, and would totally put you to sleep if it didn't have an amazing soundsystem powered by some top notch acts that play here.\n\nIn addition, it has some seating that in no way, shape, or form should be sold at full price. The seats at the far left and right sections of the main area should be avoided at all costs. They are commonly as much as any other seat in the house, but are at such a sharp viewing angle that you can only see the front of the stage. I saw a Cure concert from there recently and never was able to confirm if they in fact had a drummer in the band.\n\nAnd to top it off you are likely going to have to pay hefty ticket prices at about 50-100 dollars, have about 15 dollars in fees per ticket, and have to pay 10 dollars for low quality brews.\n\nTo enjoy this place you need to REALLY want to see whoever plays here, have some good friends with you, drink heavily before the show, stay away from the seats at the far sides, show up just in time for the show, and be ready to indulge in the intense sound this place produces because there is nothing else here that is going to entertain you.",negative,en

"Awful, awful, awful! My husband & I decided to try something new in The District for our one-year anniversary. We decided on The Elephant Bar despite several friends telling us the food was terrible. I usually don't write reviews unless the business is extraordinarily amazing or awful...this place is definitely classified as awful in my book. My husband ordered a chicken/tri-tip combo plate, which didn't look anything like the picture. The chicken was marinated in some sort of sauce that tasted like the smell of dirty feet; the tri-tip was not very good either. I ordered the Misoyaki Salmon, which was very dry and the sauce was average. The veggies were soaked in oil and appeared to be the frozen kind you throw in a saucepan. My husband is not a very picky eater, but even he agreed he would never come back. We should have trusted our instincts and celebrated at the places we know are good...Lucille's, Cheesecake Factory, GVR Cafe or even Al's Garage (bar food) put this place to shame. Don't waste your time... And now I know why such a 'high class' place puts out so many coupons.

"Весьма негативное впечатление сложилось из-за навязывания питания кормом, хотя проблема совсем не в этом. Как и следовало ожидать, ветврач совершенно не сведущ в питании домашних питомцев. Чего только стоят утверждения: что из мяса кошке не получить таурин, ежедневное употребление микродозы печени вызывет переизбыток витамина А и на видотипичном питании вы посадите кошке почки🤦‍♀️несмотря на то, что по-моему всем известно, что как раз-таки на сухарях возникают проблемы с почками, мочевыводящей и половой системами. Надо было видеть реакцию, когда сказали, что на сырой натуралке кошка 4 с лишним года😂\nДа и совет попить витамины без анализов, вызывает удивление, неужели врач не знает простой истины, что переизбыток хуже недостатка. Когда я на это указала, ветврач быстро съехала с темы, начав фразу: ""ну всё равно.."". Кстати этим советом она сама себе противоречила, ведь до этого говорила про переизбыток витамина А🙄\nВ целом, понаблюдав со стороны, назначения для других пациентов, могу с уверенностью сказать, что немало лишнего и лишь бы что подороже. Кстати, назначают симпарику, интересно, предупреждают ли, что в случае индивидуальной реакции антидота нет🤔\nВ остальном приём понравился, вызвали по времени, к которому записались. Времени уделили много. Проблему разобрали по полочкам, от и до в самых мелких деталях.\nМы в процессе лечения, посмотрим, каков будет результат.\n\nUPD Да, конечно я лучше разбираюсь как кормить мою кошку. За 8,5 лет её жизни уже всё изучено, переизучено и пробовано и перепробовано.\nНе передёргивайте, смешны же. Лучше бы вы это инфу по поводу витаминов-БАДов на приёме говорили, а не пытались впарить!\nСпасибо, что разрешили, кормить мою кошку, как я считаю правильным.\nВот это конечно ""сильный"" аргумент про весь цивилизованный мир. Давайте тогда ещё может обсудим, почему многие врачи неправильно питаются и жиреют, особенно диетологи. Или например, то, что огромное количество людей наркозависимые. Следуя вашей логике, почему бы не пойти по их стопам, ведь их же тоже много, разве они не правы..\nКрайне ""профессиональный"" совет почитать в интернете.\nКапли при первых же тревожных симптомах можно смыть!\nНа ваш взгляд, естественно, что вы назначаете, то, что считаете правильным, как иначе. Вопрос только в том, есть ли необходимость во всём сразу и есть же альтернативы, важно предлагать человеку выбор.\nЯ-то найду, если захочу. А вот вы бы лучше прислушивались к критике(обратите внимание, что моя оценка пока положительная), а не пользовались тем, что сейчас столько ленивых и занятых людей, что им не до изучения инфы. Свою же репутацию портите.",positive,ru

"Megabus is a service that is constantly improving. Better busses, better staff, better punctuality, more locations. It isn't glamorous, and it isn't necessarily comfortable or exciting, but it'll get you there.\n\nMy usual trip on the megabus is along the Pittsburgh-State College-New York line. The trip goes as follows: Board the megabus in Pittsburgh, get to State College 3 hours later, stop for 10 minutes while people get off and others board, stop at a Pilot/Subway for 25 minutes about 2 hours later(If you're reading this from the bus and wondering how long until you can get a bottle of water, it's exit 256 on rt-80), get to NYC about 3 hours later. There are some potential congestion points: The Squirrel Hill tunnels if you're leaving at rush hour(4:40p bus), and the Lincoln tunnels entering NYC(I've been caught up here for about 40 minutes once).\n\nLateness used to be a very common thing with the Megabus. When my girlfriend would grab a bus home from State College, we'd usually wait about 30 minutes for it to come, once it took at least 2 hours to come(Maybe longer, we left since she couldn't get a bus in Pittsburgh when she got back). Once it came and left 20 minutes early without waiting for her. Don't try calling customer service about it(This may have changed), they don't care - the phone number they give is to a call center, and you have to convince them to give you the real customer service number. I called asking for a refund for the bus that was 2 hours late and I was given the run-around. \""I'll leave a note for my manager, she'll call you back\"", no call - Called the manager \""I didn't see anything about this, let me check for your reservation number, hold on\"", silent hang-up. After that for some reason I could never get through to a customer service rep again, hm.\n\nLately it hasn't been late, though, and the busses have been upgraded. They used to have 1 socket per seat and sketchy wifi. The wifi is now more stable and there are 2 sockets per seat. If you have to sit next to someone, it's a lot less comfortable, but if you get the room of two seats it isn't that bad. If you sit up front on the top level you get a little extra legroom, too. However, the maximum prices have also gone up. It used to only cost $30 to go to NY, now it's $45 if you're late to the party. You can still get tickets for $1.50, and they release them a few months at a time, so I personally just spend about $10-20 on tickets if I catch them when they're just released to have the option of going.\n\nAlso the last time I went the staff in Pittsburgh was really friendly. These guys get a lot of stupid questions and complaints(On my bus home, a lady who spoke little English argued for 15 minutes that there were zero seats on the bus for the rest of her family. Sure enough, there were actually six seats and only 4 of them. Still, she argued there were zero and that they could not go home), so they really have to have a lot of patience to be in that position. Also, the one bus driver whose name is Frank, I think(He is kind of a bigger dude, wears a Steelers cap), is really funny so if you get him that's a bonus.\n\nAll-in-all it's a cheap trip from point A to point B. In Pittsburgh you board under the convention center, so you don't have to wait in the rain or anything. In New York, no such luck.",negative,en

*Good
- Staff was helpful and attentive
- Bed was comfortable
* Average
- The entrance isn't well marked or obvious at first pass
- The bedside alarm wasn't reset, so I was woken up at 6 am by a shrieking alarm clock that I didn't set

"One of, if not the worst film to come out of Britain in the 80s. This tawdry tale of a middle aged lecher who 'seduces' two teenage scrubbers who babysit for him and his faux-posh wife has nothing to redeem it.In turns gratuitous, puerile, uncouth and unrealistic, this film plumbs the depths as it fails miserably in its attempts to be funny, provocative, intellectual and controversial. Perhaps the worst thing about this film is the way the strong cast of George Costigan, Michelle Holmes and Siobhan Finneran are completely stitched by such a lame script. It's no surprise that this was the late Andrea Dunbar's only work to make it onto the screen. Complete and utter rubbish on every level.",negative,en

"We stayed at the Chelsea hotel last month for 4 days. I had always wanted to stay here as I am fascinated by the history and the art in this hotel. The art is amazing and I would recommend calling in to see it. The downside is that the hotel is severly run down. I found it such a shame that a hotel with this history has not maintained basic standards you would expect from a hotel such as a hairdryer, good air con and a room that is decorated properly. The walls had been paited over dozens of times and you could have easily kicked the door down.
I was dissapointed as I had e-mailed the hotel previously after reading some bad reviews and had expressed my concerns. The e-mail I received was quite sharp basically telling me that the hotel is not for everyone and if I didn't like it I should stay at a W hotel but they did say that my request had been noted.
When we arrived and was shown our room I called reception and asked to be moved. The guy on reception was very apologitic and he admitted that the hotel is not for everyone. I would point out that I am not a snob and I have stayed in worse places but I felt let down. The room we moved to was bigger and slightly better.
To be fair the rooms are clean and bigger than you would see in most New York hotels. The residents that live here really make the hotel. You could sit in the lobby all day and watch the many different characters pass by. We even saw Matthew Modine in the lift!!
If this hotel had a facelift to the rooms whilst still maintaing the history and character of the hotel I would come back . Other than that I would give it a miss to stay but definetly call in to walk the corridors.",negative,en

"I stayed at New York Hotel Marrakech from 22nd June for five days with a friend for her 30th We booked and pre-paid for a twin room through lastminute.com but on arrival were given a double. The reception staff were friendly and polite but all they could offer us was a room exchange the next day with an upgrade fee. The double room (44) was clean and comfortable so we stayed there.
Positives: The room was very clean and there was a maid service every day, plasma TV and decent aircon. After reading posts about bed bugs we checked all bedding defore using it, everything was clean and fresh and we did not get bitten during our stay. The hotel is four blocks away from Central Park and there is a number 1 (red line) subway station literally outside the door so you can get everywhere you need to with ease and at a low cost. The hotel is above a Starbucks but I found the café “Hot and Crusty” just a two minute walk up the road a lot better with loads of choice for breakfast or lunch.
Down sides; No lifts and no internet in the room but there is free Wi-Fi in the reception area only. The view from our room was interesting and a down side if occupied (see picture). Storage space was minimal for two females.
If you’re planning to see many sites all over the city I would recommend getting a 7-Day subway pass it Cost: $29 you can have unlimited trips and runs till midnight every day. Pedicab tour is a brilliant way to see all the famous spots round central park especially if the weather is good. A great night out is the comedy cellar, easy to get to very cheap and really funny: <url>",neutral,en

"Where the Rivers Flow North is a well-told story about two peoples' fight to live their own lives in the face of ""progress"" and development.

Very well done for a low-budget, locally-produced film. I found Michael J. Fox's character the weakest in the film, but Rip Torn and Tantoo Cardinal turn in two of the finest performances I've seen in a long time.

Also cooking food at the table is still entertaining and several dishes come with a million little addons. \n\nThe Bad: The staff were clearly running their asses off but we didn't see a lot of our waiter. Maybe we were supposed to wave them down, I saw this being done a few times (and not in an impolite fashion). All the interactions we had with the staff were good, but they were clearly overburdened.

Питание хорошее.Персонал вежливый. \nБыло всё отлично до наступления сна, как у них написано в ""23:00 соблюдайте тишину"".И сейчас буду писать негатив, так как отдых наш был испорчен...\nДля начала- если нет финансов на кондиционеры в номерах, можно хотя бы поставить вентиляторы, но их наверное не куда будет втыкать, так как розетки большинство не работают.\nИз за жары ночью открыты окна и соответственно налетели сквозь сетку мелкие мошки, которые нас искусали.И опять же если взять с собой фумигатор, то розетки сломаны.Пришлось окна всётаки закрыть и по итогу от духоты мы проснулись с ужасной головной болью. \nИ ""вишенкой на торте"" было одновременно с нами заселение выпускников подростков с 2 мя взрослыми. Их заселили к нам на этаж. За ними абсолютно никто не следил. Они носились по коридорам и орали до 4 утра, даже один раз пытались зайти к нам в номер🤦‍♀️Детей своих я еле уложила спать, сама уснула только в пятом часу и пришлось уже проснуться в 7 утра, так как эти подростки начали опять носиться и орать по коридорам. \nИз за жары и от недосыпа мы проснулись в отвратительном состоянии. И домой уехали не дожидаясь завтрака.\nВпечатления очень отвратительные от этого отдыха. Больше мы туда точно не поедем. Ценник не маленький, а комфорта 0.",negative,ru

"Decent place if you want to gorge down on some rather hefty portions, but for the price you pay, there's much better places to spend your money at in Vegas.\n\nSo it doesn't even compare to the original Serendipity in NYC, but on a scorching day walking around the strip, cooling down with a bowl of frozen hot chocolate is a genius idea...so you'd think. It's a shame that they can even manage to mess THAT up. How hard is it to use a blender? I'd like to not sip on cubes of ice in my slushy, thanks. Granted, they do have more flavors of the frozen hot chocolate here (Oreo, peanut butter, mint, etc.). If you want to keep it strictly Vegas-style, the bartender will even throw in a shot of rum for that extra umph. Of course, for an extra $10, I'd rather gamble away at the tables and order a few cocktails there instead...\n\nI can't say I'm able to compare the actual food to the NYC location since I've only tried desserts, but the mac n' cheese here was pretty legit. However, for $14?? I can buy 14 boxes of Kraft for that and be just as satisfied.",negative,en

"At last, a film to rival 'El Padrino' and 'Darkness Falls' in terms of sheer and utter dullness. This is actually the first film I've ever given 1 out of 10 for on IMDb, and with good reason.For one, the cast is nothing special. That's usually not a problem for me except that the only character that's in anyways interesting or different from all the rest is Grand L. Bush's Harrington. Secondly, the production values a substandard - television sci-fi such as 'Stargate' has more convincing sets, and all of the underwater scenes NOT handled by the SFX teams are filmed on dry sets with 'falling particles' that aren't very convincing. This film is literally 'drydocked'. The worst part though is that this film is BORING. For the first 45 minutes, I felt as if we were going round and round in circles: ""It's a prehistoric shark."" ""Bullsh*t."" ""No really."" ""Bullsh*t."" ""I'm not making this up."" ""Bullsh*t."" ""There it is now!"" ""I didn't see anything."" ""Let me guess?"" ""Yup. Bullsh*t."" After then it picks up ever so slightly for about twenty minutes or so. Then we're back to the dialog run-around. Dialog is not a bad thing, but that's all this film has. Characters talking. That too, is not a bad thing, except this film isn't very good at it. The dialog is often contrived and clichéd, and is not very interesting to listen to. I don't see any point slandering the special effects; this film has worse qualities.The sets are small and unrealistic. The acting is sub-par. The script - oh Lord, the script - is worse than a garbage of sci-fi television has to dredge up. It makes you wonder where the budget of this film is or was.Yet another awful, awful addition to the 'Megaloadon' (there's about four) series of films. Bring on Steve Alten, please...",negative,en

"Sushi Hibiki is one of the best sushi bars that I've ever visited in Kuala Lumpur. They serve the finest-quality, in-season ingredients imported from across the world, and strive to give patrons a true feel of the Japanese sushi-bar culture. All the fish served is fresh and ""clean-tasting"" (you can really taste all the flavours of the fish!), and the ratio of fish to rice is perfect (if you fill up easily, you can request for the chef to make your sushi with less rice). If you are lucky enough to catch the seasonal produce, I would highly recommend having a go at the saltwater uni, shinko fish, fresh ikura and fresh edamame. To keep up the practice of serving only the freshest ingredients, Sushi Hibiki operates with a set menu, but you are welcome to order any additional sushi / item that you fancy (with additional charges of course).Amazing food aside, Chef Sam and his team are very friendly thus creating a comfortable ambience in the restaurant. I've had some of the most beautiful dining experiences eating here with Sam and his team.The restaurant is quite small and exclusive, therefore prior reservations are recommended. I suggest taking a seat at the counter where you can watch the chefs at work, and engage in friendly conversation.",positive,en

"I'll start by saying that this hotel has an excellent location for getting about the city. The room was no worse than we had anticipated but could do with some redecoration. My main gripe with the hotel was the inadequacy of the sound proofing. A neighbouring room had for some reason a CD or radio playing the same song continuously all through the night every night. After ringing security the music stopped only to start again the following night. To top it off we got a wake-up call at 5.45am on our check-out morning which we hadn't requested. When I went down to reception to investigate, the lady asked me if the room was under...and gave me my name without so much as querying who I actually was. I would normally expect to be asked ""what name is the room under?""

"I, unfortunately, rarely make it out to this part of town. When I do, I tend to go an binges, scarfing down food from one or two of my favorite spots, and adding a new place that has been on my must-try list. This time, it was La Condesa. \n\nEverything about La Condesa took me by surprise, regardless of the high expectations I already had. I loved its interior--the small space, the rustic wood furniture, the artwork, everything. A big departure from the usual feel of cheap-mexican restaurants/taquerias, it felt homey, warm, inviting. I was expecting to just shoot a quick order to the girl at the counter, but instead got table service, and extremely friendly and attentive service to boot (sounds like it's usually an order-at-the-counter place, though). \n\nOn to the food: don't expect the usual suspects at the salsa bar--these salsas and toppings were phenomenal. I didn't ask, but I suspect they were all made in-house, and seemed incredibly fresh and were really a unique assortment. A great mellow, nutty peanut sauce, smokey chipotle salsa, creamy/salty cilantro, an awesome Mexican (or was it Mayan?) salsa (my favorite of what I tried)...my only regret was not sampling more.\n\nWhat I loved about the menu were the unique options that branched far beyond the usual suspects. I went with three tacos: tinga, mole, cochinita pibil. When they arrived, all of them looked beautiful, and were surprisingly and thankfully chocked-full of meat. I took one bite of the mole and...HO...LY.....SHIT. Ever go to a restaurant and casually take a bite of something without giving it too much thought, only to be immediately punched in the face by its deliciousness? I love it when this happens. It's one of those pure joys in life, and happens far too infrequently...but it happened here. I'm a sucker for any type of mole, but sometimes they fall a bit 'flat'. This one did not. It had a fantastic bite and complexity to it that really elevated the mole to one of the best I've had. The tinga and cochinita were both equally great. The meat in all three was insanely tender and flavorful from the great sauces they had simmered in.\n\nI paid the bill--$9.80--and realized that it was an awesome deal. Sure, you can find tacos in town for less than $3/ea, but they will not be like these. Not to mention, the portions were generous, I got free chips and a run at the salsa bar. \n\nI drove home feeling like I was teetering on the edge of purging...this was, after all, my second substantial meal in the course of 1 hour. But it was well worth it. Adding yet another spot to my list of places I have to hit when in the area. Already searching for an excuse.",positive,en

"I like that Blackfinn has three distinct atmospheres that it implements in any given day. \n\n1) In the early afternoon and evenings, the establishment resembles any typical American bar, offering a decent selection of drinks (at normal market prices), and a number of different pub foods with sports coverage on all of their many mounted televisions.\n\n2) One also has the choice of forgoing the bar and having a dine-in experience with a full waiting staff in a much quieter and cleaner setting. The food is presented nicely and tastes quite good for a pub. Blackfinn, hands down, has the best Lime Grilled Salmon that I've had in Charlotte. The fish is nicely crisp on the outside, with a salty bite and flaky core. Sandwiches are also delicious/cheap and the french fries resemble the extra crispy french fries at Burger King. Go for the Blackened Chicken Sandwich! Notable appetizers: Ying & Yang Shrimp, Spinach and Artichoke Dip, and Blackened Brie\n\n3) At nights and on most (some?) weekends, the bar turns into a makeshift nightclub. You'll always find this place packed on a Saturday evening with a live DJ spinning upstairs and a large dance floor that gets filled around midnight when everyone is wasted out of their minds. You have to pay cover, but it isn't very much and the music is semi-ok :)\n\nAlways come here with company, otherwise you'll stick out like a sore thumb. Often you'll see the Charlotte workforce coming here after work for a quick pint, so don't feel awkward if you're the only one dressed casually. Waiting staff is friendly and attentive. Just don't piss anyone off :P\n\nThe tables are kinda (inevitably) sticky!!\n\n4/5",neutral,en

"Yet again, I appear to be the only person on planet Earth who is capable of criticizing Japanese films made before 1970. ""Fires on the Plain"" (1959) is another in the seemingly endless line of ""classics"" that get all sorts of praise for no apparently good reason. As much as I love to overgeneralize and psychoanalyze all of these moviegoers who have such horrible taste in film, it's still nearly impossible to rationalize why anyone would ever think that poorly made fluff like this should be proclaimed as some sort of ""masterpiece."" What I find truly ironic is that fans of derivative ""classics"" like ""Fires on the Plain"" focus so much on ""inside the box"" movie-making (orthodox grading standards like scriptwriting, acting, camera-work, etc.) yet it always seems like the most highly revered ""classics"" are most deficient in these very standards. For example, one of the laziest copouts for a filmmaker involves forced verbal exposition where characters basically explain everything for the viewer even when the constructed scenario is totally artificial. Most surprisingly, the very first scene in ""Fires on the Plain"" uses this indolent tactic to the extreme.After a funny head slap, the following useless dialogue assaults the viewer, ""Why can't you grasp the situation? We landed to the west under heavy fire to reinforce units at Tacloban. We lost two-thirds of our men. Our artillery was sunk in transit. We tried to reach Burauen airfield by crossing the central mountains but without artillery it was impossible. The enemy's counterattack forced a fanout across the valley. You know that."" So why, exactly, is one character telling another character something he already knows? Oh yeah, that's right, the makers of this film are too lazy to think of more natural ways to communicate this information. You see, a quality film would actually show these events happening, or at worst it would involve dialogue involving one character who has no knowledge of those events. Heck, even an opening summary in paragraph form directed at the viewer would have been better than what transpired here.Such instances of poor quality movie-making are littered throughout ""Fires on the Plain"" to the point where this film feels like it was written by imbeciles for imbeciles. For example, the lead character stumbles upon some skeletons wrapped in Japanese garb. Instead of doing the natural thing like  oh I don't know  giving a depressed mannerism, the character blurts out ""Japanese soldiers."" Thanks buddy, but I could have figured that one out for myself.Even worse, this movie is saturated with over-dramatic ploys. The most ridiculous scene involves a pair of boots. Picture this. A soldier walks along and finds a pair of worn out boots. One would think that such a find is utterly useless, but it turns out that the soldier's boots are in even worse condition, so he picks up the worn boots and leaves his SUPER worn boots behind. Fine, I get the point. The soldiers are in rough shape  a fact that is already clearly emphasized with their worn boots to begin with. The scene is ridiculous, but I was ready to let it go, until the SECOND soldier arrives! You see, he finds the previous soldier's SUPER worn boots and notices  get ready, cause here it comes  that his boots are SUPER DUPER worn boots! Lucky man, he picks up the SUPER worn boots and leaves his SUPER DUPER worn boots behind. But you see, that's not all  because the THIRD soldier then arrives! He finds the previous soldiers SUPER DUPER worn boots and inspects them, along with his own SUPER DUPER worn boots. Since both pairs suck, he tosses them both aside and smiles as he continues barefoot. At this point I was ready to throw my television through my living room window. The heavy handedness, overdramaticism, and paramount absurdity of this sequence is beyond bad film-making. It's SUPER DUPER bad film-making.There are a number of similar, completely stupid moments to be had. Like the time when the lead character asks someone, ""Hey, are you dead?"" Like the guy is going to answer ""Yes"" if he actually kicked the bucket. I'll also be the first to condemn the subpar performance of the lead actor, who is the quintessential posterchild for artificial reaction. I laughed hard during that opening head slap where his head slingshot back in place with this stupid, goofy expression on his face.The fact that this trivial fluff piece gets an IMDb average rating of 8.4 while a certifiable masterpiece like ""A Tale of Two Sisters"" (2003) only gets a 7.5 is the height of mass stupidity. And to think that some people actually delude themselves into thinking that ""AToTS"" doesn't make sense. Well, not every movie can have completely outrageous SUPER DUPER worn boots on its side.",negative,en

"I will agree with those reviews that are claiming the food was bland. It really, really, was. I had the Lobster Ravioli and boyfriend had Potato Wrapped Salmon. His portion was generous, and salmon cooked well, but there was very little flavor. No use of herbs, spices, seasoning..nothing. My lobster ravioli was a fairly skimpy portion for $25 ... four decently sized ravioli and 3 small shrimp. Once again, I wouldn't mind this, had it not been so bland. The sauce was completely unimaginative and left a lot to be desired.\n\nThe service was adequate. We were seated immediately and our server was fine.

هذه البلد آن لها أن تستقر علي أيدينا . ميزة كلاب الراعي هو ألقاء الضوء علي فترة من الزمان كانت أيدينا هنا تشير إلي المماليك، الفرنسيس، الإنجليز، الباب العالي ، محمد علي ،ولا عزاء للمصريين. ولكن هل تغير الحال الأن؟. قد تقوم دولة بعض الوقت بمستبد كفء، ولكن لا يوجد أبدا مستبد عادل . قالها الكثير من الحكام السابقين وحتي حاكمها الحالي. من ونحن لا نسمع سوي عن الأستقرار المزعوم علي أيدي أحد الرعاه. قالها مبارك واصفا سنة ، أستقر فيها الفقر والمرض علي حالهم، وأستقر رجال ا عمال المرضي عليهم في تحقيق الثروات. قالها المجلس العسكري واصفا حال مصر بعد الثورة، ما يقرب من سنتين من ثورة مستمرة..هي ا مر الوحيد المستقر، الشباب كما هم في ثورتهم والأخوان يجهزون للسلطة مستقرين. قالها ا خوان بعدها ، إستقروا في مناصبهم وتركوا بقية الشعب مستقر كما هو، الفقراء في فقرهم، الشباب في ثورتهم. ثم قالها المجلس العسكري/مدني مرة أخري ، ليستقر الفقر مكانه، الشباب ثورتهم ولكن بقمع أكثر، وا خوان في تفجيراتهم وانتقامهم. وما أنعش هذا الإستقرار الذي تشهده البلاد ، وما أكثر كلاب الراعي بيننا ، أيا كان الراعي. لو عاش بطل الرواية حتي ا ن والذي كان يدون التاريخ في مخطوطات ، لمات كمدا. فهنا الرواية تعود لبداية القرن التاسع عشر..قبل مذبحة مروعة شهيرة..من أجل البلد التي آن وقتها أن تستقر. والبطل هنا هو. الحسن بن جمال الدين الرومي ، الشاطر حسن. . ورحلته في الجهاد مع محمد علي باشا وأتباعه ضد المماليك التي أزداد نفوذها با خص مع الحملة الإنجليزية ، إزداد ضغيانها والظلم تجاه المصريين الذين عاشوا أزهي عصور فرض الضرائب، والفقر..وتنتهي بصعود محمد علي إلي الحكم. صعوده ليحقق الإستقرار لهذه البلد التي آن ، وقتها ، أن تستقر. كتاريخ أعتقد أنها ممتازة في كثير من الجوانب ، كيف كان أخر عهد المماليك؟ ودور الإنجليز فيه، وتعجبت لإستمرار وجود الفرنسيس حيث لم أعلم هذا قبلا وتقديمهم لمشروع قناة السويس لمحمد علي، كما صور الكتاب حياة الشعب المصري بهذا الوقت ونظرة ا جانب لنا، ولا تنس أن المماليك وحتي محمد علي نفسه منهم...أجانب. وصف مصر و ا سواق وحركة ا بطال بين القاهرة ، جزيرة الزمالك و الصعيد كانت ممتازة وتشعر فعلا انك انتقلت لتلك الأجواء الساحرة. وصف المولد أيضا كان موفقا ولكن يعيب الوصف المشاهد الجنسية التي كان يمكن الإستغناء عنها في بعض المواقف ، او إختصارها كما للأسف تم إختصار الجزء التاريخي بالنهاية ...فحتي الفصل قبل ا خير شعرت بعده أني كنت أريد معرفة المزيد، ماذا حدث بعد أن تولي محمد علي الحكم أدي لأحداث نهاية الكتاب، ماذا حدث لمشروع قناة السويس المقدم من الفرنسيس وما دار بين محمد علي وبينهم، لماذا ما حدث لعمر مكرم و جرجس بعد توليه الحكم؟. كما يعيب الجزء التاريخي في بعض ا جزاء كأجزاء المعارك أنه كان مجرد سرد للأحداث فقط ولكن للأسف هذا كان سببا لئلا يرق لي الجانب الروائي بها بشكل كبير.. كان سرد فحسب مما لم يجعلني اتعايش مع كثير من الأجزاء. كمثلا تجد جزء ك فدخل س القاعة ليجد ص الذي يهمس بكلمات في أذنه ثم يدخل للوالي ، فيخبره بما حدث ويخرج من عنده عازما علي ما خططه أو أجزاء أخري يأتي بها الحوار جامدا وتقليديا في بعض ا حيان. يجب أن أشير أنني من المعجبين بقلم أستاذ أشرف العشماوي وتنويعه في الروايات، ولكن ما جعل تقييمي للرواية ينخفض هو أن بين صفحات الكتاب التي تعج بمشاهد سردية مقتضبة هناك رواية ملحمية تصرخ تريد أن تروي لكن كتمها الاختصار. الإختصار هنا قدم بعض الأحداث التاريخية والمعارك مكتوبة بطريقة جافة ، أو شخصيات ليست بالعمق الكافي للتعاطف معها بشكل كلي فلم يؤدي لتسارع ا حداث للأسف بقدر إقتضابها. فرواية عن أخر عهد المماليك، صعود محمد علي، وتنتهي بمذبحته الشهيرة تحتمل أو صفحة علي ا قل. ربما ن ما قرأته من روايات تاريخية كان عملاقا مثل رواية. سقوط العمالقة لكين فوليت. ، أو تاريخ غير حقيقي ك. لعبة العروش لجورج آر آر مارتن. تخطي كلاهما ال صفحة قطع كبير. ما يجعلني متأكدا من هذا هو أنني لم أتعايش مع شخصية الشاطر حسن سوي عندما بدأ جزء رحلته إلي الصعيد حيث كان في الرواية مكتوبا بأسلوب البطل حسن هو الراوي ..وبشكل ممتاز. كما أن بعد منتصف الرواية أيضا كانت هناك أجزاء كثيرة لأخيه كمال الدين مطولة فيها حديث نفسي وهي أيضا كتبت ببراعة ،وربما أدت لتعاطفي حتي مع شخصيته في النهاية. حتي محمد علي في بعض ا جزاء البسيطة كان مكتوبا بعمق. ولكن بعض النظر عن كل هذا ، فالشخصية الوحيدة التي قدمت هنا بشكل مطول ويليق بها وبوصف خلاب ، بشكل واقعي ومؤسف بنفس الوقت هي البلد. مصر. البلد التي آن لها أن تستقر. من القرن الثامن عشر وحتي ا ن نبحث عن إستقرار حقيقي لها، ولكن كلاب الراعي لا ترعاها قدر رعايتها للراعي نفسه..ولمصلحتها ومصلحة الراعي. بلد تبحث إستقرار لشعبها الذي لعشقه وشوقه للإستقرار قد يرضي بإستقرارات زائفة مؤقتة. يفسدها دائما كلاب الراعي. محمد العربي. من أبريل . إلي ابريل,neutral,ar

Als der Gürtel bei mir ankam, war ich total zufrieden. Das Leder und die Schnalle machen einen sehr hochwertigen Eindruck und das Gesamtbild sah an jeder Hose wirklich sehr gut aus.

Das Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis schien am Anfang top zu sein, nun hat der Zahn der Zeit aber doch ganz schön seine Spuren hinterlassen. Die Schnalle ist auf der Oberseite total abgekratzt und sieht durch den Orangestich wie Rost aus. Das Leder ist rundum noch in einem super Zustand, nur an der Schnalle sind helle Verfärbungen erkennbar, die aber momentan gar nicht weiter auffallen oder stören.

"Druckstellen im Buch - Poster nicht kindgerecht
Ich habe einmal bestellt ohne die Rezension zu lesen - ein Fehler! Das Buch sollte ein Geschenk für einen Kindergeburtstag sein. Das Poster erschien mir als nette Zugabe. Doch: Das Poster ist nicht - wie man auf der Produktabbildung vermuten könnte - in einer Rolle der Bestellung beigefügt, sondern mehrfach gefaltet mit Büroklammern (wer kommt auf so eine Idee???) in dem Buch befestigt. Die Büroklammern haben in dem Buch an den Seiten die damit in Berührung kamen deutliche Druckstellen hinterlassen! Druckstellen sieht man bei genauer Betrachtung auch an dem Poster. Dieses ist allerdings so wenig kindgerecht (das Buch ist empfohlen für 4-7 Jahre und den Bildern nach zu urteilen dafür auch passend). Zudem ist das Poster durch das Falten so zerknickt, dass es sich sicher niemand an die Wand hängen würde. Diese Bestellung geht zurück!

"This is one of those airport hotels that you'll probably choose if you need to stay a night and close to the airport for your next day flight, but we stayed there mostly because I was supposed to get a shuttle from the airport on my own and I didn't want to pay a lot for a shuttle to some hotel closer to the city. Plus, we had a car, so reaching Houston downtown wasn't that much of a problem. Well, if you don't have problems with navigating Houston highways, which can be a bit challenging. The hotel isn't big, it's clean, the staff was very friendly and helpful, so the lady at the front desk told us to go eat to the near by restaurant where we got 15% discount for her reference, which was a nice gesture. The hotel room was a regular size with two big queen beds and a smaller bathroom. The noise from the airport wasn't notable because of the sound proof windows, but the AC was pretty noisy and it was pointing towards the beds. The breakfast was an usual buffet with good choice of food. Overall, a pretty decent two nights stay.",positive,en

"The best part of this hotel is the location. If you are going for the first time to San Francisco here is what you need to know about this hotel ...
There is no parking lot in the hotel. There is a parking lot across the street that will charge you $32 per day if you leave the car all day without getting in or out the parking lot (if you go in or out you will be charge the hourly rate). The hotel will may or not tell you that you can pay them a flat fee of $42 a day with the option to take your car in or out the parking lot as many time you want.
The hotel does not have a bellboy. There is only one loading parking in front of the hotel so you can unload your bags. Don't expect for anyone to open your doors. ( I was with my pregnant wife and I was hassling with my bags).
The standard rooms are very small, but nice and clean. The only problem are the walls that are very thin. There was a couple next door having sex for an hour around 5:00 AM, at the same time you can hear when others are flushing the toilet or sitting on their bed. There is no fart vent in the bathroom so if you are on a honeymoon gateway weekend, don't eat beans (you can hear everything even when the door is close). The bed is very small and fit two people but very tight.
You can purchase certain tour passes at the hotel, The tour bus is great because one of the bus stops is just across the street.
There is not fridge in the standard room, no cable on demand. Certain amenities are located on one floor only, ex. ice. There is free drinking bottle of water on each floor (the have empty plastic bottles (sealed) that you will fill from a filter fountain water machine) Very convenience.
There is a restaurant (pub) attach to the hotel which is nice because it is open until 12:00 AM so you can drink all you want and then walk to your room.
The hotel staff are very courteous and helpful. I paid $162+tax at night and I can't complaint much about the hotel. You can get a better hotel for an additional $60 but that is an additional $120 that you could use to to book a tour bus for 2.

"I'm a Marriott rewards member and not one of my requests were acknowledged at check-in. I even called ahead to make sure I got a high floor since this hotel accepts animals and I was told they generally keep them on the lower floors. So of course at check-in, I'm given a room on the first floor and cant be moved until morning since they are booked-up. There were so many problems here I can't even imagine trying to detail everything in one review so i'll be brief. Front desk was a bit scatty-boo and un-organized, elevator broke during our stay and was never repaired, our card keys only worked once and a while which is really awesome when you need it to get into the parking lot (so yea, cars are waiting behind you and your stupid card wont work). The room layout is the most idiotic thing I have ever seen. Our room had two bedrooms with one bathroom that is only accessible through the master room. VERY inconvenient for anyone sleeping in there, it was so annoying. Housekeeping rarely ever did anything to our room and would never refill or replace anything. I had to call the front desk to get tissue replaced and after 2 days it was replaced. I requested additional pillows my second day there and those didn't even show up until day 5. That's just to list a few things that happened. This hotel truly made me give up any hope of salvaging our stay. I hated every moment spent there. The only redeeming thing this hotel had was the breakfast, it was great.",negative,en

"Thanksgiving weekend getaway.
-Located steps from Times Square but most hotels in Midtown are a comfortable walking distance to different attractions.
-We requested a quiet, bigger room with a river view and after the runaround we got our request then we were on our own after check-in. (Get a bigger room, at least you'll have the space)
-The bathroom was small, out-dated, stained tub and had broken fixtures.
-We needed a late check-out and the response was quite impersonal 'we can't do it but the bellman can hold your bags'. No name for this person? Is an extra two hours due to emergency a big deal?
-Expensive in-room service with okay food.

Alors oui, vous allez me dire que je n'aurais alors pas dû regarder ce film mais ma curiosité m'y a fortement poussé. Pour ce qui est des scènes trash et gores car c'est ce qui prédomine dans le film, elles sont pour le coup bien réalisées et réalistes et les acteurs sont d'ailleurs très bon. Il y aurais pu y avoir une réelle histoire derrière tout cela car celle-ci fait un peu prétexte pour faire un film malsain et c'est dommage car certains dialogues entre la journaliste et le spécialiste sont intéressants mais malheureusement sous-exploités.

"После посещения данного заведения остались крайне неприятные ощущения, в частности от закройщика. Хотели заказать дочке платье на выпускной, но после первой всречи передумали обращаться к таким специалистам!Объясняю почему: На витрине продавались поношеные платья с порваными, грязными оттоптаными подолами... Весьма хабалистая женщина, рассказывала нам с дочерью что люди в городе в часности и многие клиенты, которые к ним приходили, не умеют одеваться, при этом сама высказывающаяся стояла в дешёвой застиранной майке из масмаркета и непонятных джинсовых шортах явно маловатых по размеру , а на голове грязная масса из нерасчесанных волос...( мне кажется достойный закройщик так безвкусно одеваться на рабочем месте не должен ). Складывалось впечатление что перед нами не работник ателье, а дамочка любящая частенько выпить. С таким отнашением закройщика к клиентам, зная что после и нас так будут за спиной поносить , идти в данное ателье и заказывать выпускное платье нам расхотелось на корню.\nВ конце разговора к нам ещё вышла стилист, начала что-то рассказывать на повышенном нервном и доказывать что они лучшие в городе , по одежде я сначала вообще подумала что это женщина легкого поведения, пока она не сообщила что является стилистом.\nЯ решила не тратить своё время и деньги на ателье неадекватов.",negative,ru

"Hotel Mela is marketed as a 4* hotel but I'm afraid I would only rate it as 3*. The location however is most definitely 5*. Ideal for walking to all the Broadway shows. Frankly it seemed quite decadent to only have a 5 minute stroll back to the hotel. Stayed here recently and would recommend but ask for a room not overlooking the adjacent aircon vents if you value your night's sleep. Possibly this is all part and parcel of staying so close to Times Sq but be forewarned. Yes the rooms are compact but this is NY so don't be surprised. We found a great rate on a booking website but emailed the hotel directly and they were quite willing to match it. The 4* status seems to be achieved by the provision of up market toiletries, good quality linens and towels and similar little extras but I have stayed in other 4* hotels of far superior quality. But to be honest for NY if you get a good rate you couldn't possibly go wrong in choosing the Mela.",negative,en
"Buyer beware! Misleading product disclosure and very poor customer service.
I ordered these Samson Stage 200 Handheld wireless mics because they were reasonably priced, had good reviews and I have ordered another Samson Microphone before and was very happy with it. However, when these microphones arrived, there was a sticker across the entry point of the box saying that if I opened the package that they would not be returnable. Now, how exactly am I to determine whether these microphones work or if they suit my needs without opening the package? I went back and checked the listing page on Amazon for this product and found nothing that said that I couldn't open the box! A couple days after I contacted the company, they responded to say that I needed to contact Amazon for a return authorization and return them. Now, these microphones may, in fact, be fine but I'll never know because now I have to send them back, order something else and hope that they arrive before the event that I need them for. VERY disappointing and should explain why I gave them only one star. I don't know how I could have prevented this from happening, but I'm suggesting that other buyers beware of this company and their lack information concerning it's product policy and poor customer service.",negative,en
"THE PROS
-- Unique decor, hip feel
-- Great proximity to Times Square and lots of attractions
-- Helpful staff
-- Good, stout drinks at the bar
-- Turndown service
-- Town car service available (additional cost)
-- Concierge will check your bags upon checkout so you can enjoy the city more before your depature.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
THE CONS
- Teeny tiny rooms. By our estimation, ours was about 10x12, and according to the fire escape map, it was one of the smallest, but not by much. The bathroom was barely big enough for one person at a time, let alone two. And we're not big people.
-- Bar was closed for repairs during the first part of our stay
-- Slow elevator service (and it's itty bitty). On our last day, the stairs were closed for maintenance (we were on the 2nd floor and the stairs were much quicker than the elevator). We had luggage (just one bag) and couldn't get on the tiny elevator because when it DID stop for us, it was packed already. We waited a good 15 minutes for another one (there are only 7 or so floors in this hotel) before we could finally get downstairs.
-- Toilet paper holder was falling off the wall. I notified the staff on our first day and it was never fixed.
-- Water did not drain in the shower. By the end of your shower, you would be standing in a good 2-3 inches of water. Ick. I notified staff on our first day and it appears that they tried to pour drain cleaner in (saw blue residue around the drain later that day), but it did no good.
-- Not sure the maids ever vacuumed. They should probably take note that because they have dark carpet, it shows EVERYTHING.
-- No windows. But that's kind of expected.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
OTHER NOTES
-- No ice machine. You'll have to call the front desk and they'll bring you ice.
-- Be careful with the mini fridge. Each item is on a sensor so it will notify the front desk when one is removed and you will be charged for it. My husband quickly picked up a little bottle of Jack Daniels just to look at it for some reason (he had not been listening to the front desk clerk when we checked in so he missed her warning) and I had to notify the front desk that we put it right back and didn't drink it. The items are pretty pricey, as can be expected.
-- There is a convenience store across the street at Grace with beer, water, etc. Didn't realize this until the end of our trip, but it's handy.",negative,en

"I have found this a deeply frustrating experience. The main lecturer, Professor Adam Gearey, clearly knows his subject well but is a terrible communicator. His lectures are poorly constructed, repetitious and sometimes confusing. He seems at times to be delivering the lecture as a stream of consciousness rather than a properly prepared lecture: as a result he sometimes misspeaks himself, for example saying that murder trials are conducted in the High Court rather than the Crown Court, and these errors have not been picked up and corrected. I am forced to wonder whether anybody in the University of London team bothered to quality check these videos. These problems are compounded by the uncorrected subtitles and transcripts of the lectures, obviously done by somebody with no understanding of the subject. It is also frustrating that when I raised these concerns in the weekly discussion forum, I received replies from a volunteer moderator which were so badly written as to be almost unintelligible. This moderator made no attempt to enter into constructive discussion, but told me that you cannot say our professor is wrong because you disagree with him and that I should read the sentence properly: in other words, no criticism, however constructive, can be tolerated. Even some of the questions in the quizzes are carelessly constructed: for example, the correct answer to q8 in the final quiz uses the word allowed (which implies an element of discretion) instead of required, which would have properly reflected the provision in question (s.6 HRA 1998 - the authority could not have acted differently ). All in all, the presentation of this course falls far short of the academic standards I expected from a university with Londons reputation.",negative,en

"The main problem i had with this hotel was that our room was tiny. It was, basically, a single room, with a double bed in it (and not much room for anything else). There was no where to hang up more than a couple of coats, so, we lived out of our suitcases for 4 days (which we had to keep moving about to make space).
Also, the pipes made a racket, first thing in the morning.
However, it is in an ideal location (a minutes walk from Broadway). So, for the price we paid for the room, it was a bargin. But, i really wouldn't recommend this hotel because the rooms were so small.
Our next stop was the 'Comfort Inn' in Downtown Memphis, the rooms were massive, good breakfast included, free internet access (I would definately recommend that hotel!)

"Since I often feel that the natural world is out of balance without at least some negative comment to make, and because I couldn't find fault with either food or service, here's what I was left with..\n Isn't it incorporated in the Uniform Articles Of Ambience that for a Cafe to operate as such, that it has to meet at least the minium expectations of comfort and cosiness?\n While Bertha's for the most part delivers on these points, the glaring error to me is in their choice of servicewear; specifically the ubiquitous presence of plastic--- cups, bowls, plates, flatwear, et al.\n Plastic is unnatural. It's the antithesis of comfort and not a bit eco-friendly, (you haven't heard?) regardless of recycle practices. It robs the patron of that tactile sense of solidity and well being that even the most humble ceramic and stainless provide. (Check out Cafe Zupas' attractive dinnerware.)\n In patio use, it's totally impractical and frustrating, having to battle even moderate breezes for control of your food. Not exactly Zen.\n Sure, Bertha's colorful and delicious offerings \""show\"" very well against gloss black, and it's convenient for management, but is it really a fair trade to the customer?\n Hey, if I'm slumming for chow at Arby's or Wendy's I expect cheap and easy and I'll go w/ the flow, but here I want and expect more. Bertha's Choice makes me feel as though I'm in that alternate universe where everything is pretty cool, except...\n So, Bertha's, I wouldn't mention this if it didn't actually matter to me. Your exclusive use of plasticwear makes me feel like a teen with ketchup on my chin from the fries and with the napkins flying away to become litter.\n Thing is, you're primarily serving grownups.\n \nA minor warning to anyone ordering anything containing salami: while tasty, the salami is very potent and tends to overwhelm the more creative yet delicate ingredients. The same point was made by another Yelper as well, so I'm not alone in this view.\n\n On the upside, my cashier went out of her way to accommodate my wish for a breakfast item I craved, well outside of breakfast service times.\n Beyond the above, The imaginative and delish menu items, (take some baked goods to go) good service, and comfortable atmosphere are as real as the many positive reviews imply.",neutral,en

"This place is a borderline 1 star for me. It wasn't like as if I found a bug or anything atrocious. But it was shockingly disappointing. \n\nThe Buffet, along with the rest of Aria, seem immaculate. We've stayed at the Aria before and was impress with the rooms. So it would seem logical that the food was equally impressive. When I took a quick look around, the presentation of the food looked nice.\n\nHowever looks can be very deceiving. I tried the orange glazed ham. It was dry with no hint of orange. The grilled vegetables were also over done. The clam chowder was ok but nothing a can of Campbell's soup cant replace. I tried the Mexican clams. It was underwhelming and the taste did not go well together. Got a couple of warm crab legs but the meat on it was rather dry. Since we came in the late afternoon we were also able to sample the dinner menu. I was actually looking forward to the King Snow Crab legs but they were equally disappointing.\n\nThe only good thing I can say about this place is that the gelato was pretty good. \n\nThe service was a bit of a disappointment as well. Since our regular waitress couldn't be found for a good 10 minutes, I flagged down 2 passing servers asking them for the tool to crack open the crab legs. They hardly acknowledged me and as they were walking away one waiter says to the other \""Why me?\"" before hesitantly coming back to get me what I needed. \n\nDefinitely would not be back here. Living up to its name, this is THE BUFFET to avoid.",negative,en

"I must admit, this is probably the only option for a good steak in KL, and I am sure there are people who may disagree. I have been to the Prime a few times, and the steak and restaurant ambience have not let me down thus far. BUT...I need to make a quick comment, in regards to hygiene and cleanliness of the chef preparing the food. we were seated very near the food station, where we can view through the glass panel to see what the chefs are doing, this is what the establishment wanted us to do, to view with comfort and eat in peace. I was kinda disgusted that the chef at the front was picking something to eat with his bare hand, while preparing the food to be served by the waiters. He did not stop eating, even when he saw me starring. the next horror that I saw, was he used the same bare hands to pick up fresh vegetable apparently to be served as salad greens, and that was without even washing his hands. how can this be in a 5 star Le Meridien and the Prime! I think this has to be stopped and discouraged. if he really wants to munch something, he should just go to be back kitchen where no one could see and not doing that so openly. that just lead to another imagination, what else is the unhygienic stuff he as been doing if he was so brave to disregard to feeling of the paying customers. that really put us off. by the way, my wife's fillet mignon which was ordered as medium rare came as well done. we had to send it back. however, I must say that my Augusta Rib Eye was perfect. someone reading this should take some actions.

"The hubs and I decided to try this place out on a particularly icky rainy Sunday afternoon. Perhaps because the weather was gross or that we came smack in the middle of the afternoon, Bang Bang was really quiet. It gave me a chance to appreciate their decor and choice of music (Sinatra was on). It's a nice, cozy place with a warm interior. I dig that. \n\nWe tried the cheeseburger eggrolls, the Hangover with regular fries, and the Brie burger with sweet potato fries. We were really surprised at how well the cheeseburger eggrolls turned out. My only advise there is to make sure you order enough and wait a moment for them to cool. Hubs had the Hangover burger and let me try a bite. I liked it. I wish it just had a couple pieces of crispy whole bacon to round it off. My Brie burger was awesome. The tomato jam was sweet and mellow which really complements the brie and arugula. Normally I don't dig big wads of greens on my burger, but this stack was well balanced and tender, so it was pleasant. I think my one regret was getting a single because the Duke's Bread buns are a little too bulky to carry just one patty. Then again, I couldn't even finish my food (which is saying a lot considering I'm a fluffy girl in the Gabriel Iglesias sense), so that's probably more reflective of the bun just being too big. All these were good.......but the sweet potato fries with maple sauce....those were great. I can't really pin down why the sauce is so perfect. It's sweet, but it's not frosting sweet. It's tangy, but not ketchup tangy. Ugh, IDK, but it's delicious with the salted sweet potato fries. The regular fries are top notch too, but getting great regular fries has really become a standard expectation these days. I like that this place offers so many healthy options too. It makes feeding a mixed palate group much easier (though you won't catch me wolfing down broccoli with garlic oil any time soon; in fact, that's the only thing GHWB and I agree on politically: no broccoli. I don't like it. Well except for Chinese broccoli, but that's another post.). \n\nSo final opinion is that this is definitely the best burger joint we've seen in CLT so far, but it could use a few improvements like smaller buns for singles and a build your own burger option on the menu.",neutral,en

"Hands down, one of the best shopping experiences I have had - and I am comparing to all of them, not just fish.\n\nI was seeking a brand new, custom tank. I shopped around but Aquatouch had a good price and, more importantly, the best service. From start to finish, everything was covered - tank and stand. All of my questions were answered (and I had a lot!). I just got the tank this week and it's beautiful! I am still getting follow-up support on setting up the tank.\n\nI want to note something very important - I always felt like I was dealing with honest people.\n\nThe store itself is clean and neat. They focus more on saltwater than fresh. I'm not a saltwater expert but I would say their selection is good. The saltwater fish are all active and appear \""happy\"" to me. The planted freshwater tanks are beautiful. I think they specialize in more of the high end freshwater fish and plants.\n\nThis store will remain tops on my list. If you are going to make that huge investment in a large tank, I would just go to Aquatouch. I already did the research for you.

"Symbologist Robert Langdon (Hanks) is called to Rome to help decipher the mystery behind the Illuminati before a new science experiment blows up the city.The Da Vinci Code broke records in 2006 but for the vast majority of Dan Brown followers it did not do his award winning book justice and though running at a good 2 and a half hours, seemed to bore many.Having read the book, I was perhaps one of the few who enjoyed Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou attempt to solve the mystery of the murder in the Louvre but for Angels and Demons the scales were raised once more as lead star and director return.Having asked around, most people seem to prefer Angels and Demons to The Da Vinci code for an entertaining read and it seems as critiques and fans, whilst still not fully justified, prefer this latest adaptation to the 2006 release.This Howard picture certainly has a more clinical energy and exercise to it as unlike Da Vinci, Tom Hanks' Robert Langdon has only one night to solve the mysterious activities of the forgotten Illuminati in the Vatican and because of the time limitations, the action and desperation up the ante and deliver an excitement that certainly beats The Da Vinci code but also generates plenty of twists and stunning murder sequences.The interesting factor of this 2009 release is the constant elements being justified for the murders. Earth, wind, water and fire are all included in drastic and powerful sequences to pronounce a feeling of overall power to the situation.This really does justify the tag of thriller with a constant tension and sharp drama with the issues and beliefs once more given a full working over.Just like 3 years ago, there are many debates and discoveries of symbols once believed to be lost forever and Langdon is again the key character to show everyone the light in and amongst the controversy of other pressing circumstances.It is fair to say Dan Brown is a complex writer; he certainly likes to cram issues and dramas in amongst his action and thrilling sequences. As well as trying to discover the Illuminati, there is also the scenario of the election of a new pope, the dealings with a new scientific experiment and the power of Religion is again present. All interesting to discover and listen to, if occasionally the debates and dialogue tend to send your mind drifting but as there is so much in the novel, this was always likely.Ron Howard, who kept a frankly ordinary type of direction rolling in Da Vinci, returns in perhaps the worst way possible. His jerky ever moving camera styling does nothing to keep the pressure up, and we can never fully accept what is happening on screen thanks to this frankly awfully portrayed style. He is certainly no Paul Greengrass and this is by no means Bourne.Slick and stylized this is faster and more interesting than Da Vinci",positive,en

画像だとちょっと野暮ったく、でかいように感じましたが実物はそんなことはなく、 高級感があり思っていたより小さかったです。 今までは読書やパソコンに向かう時など腕時計の置き場に困ってましたが これがあれば愛機を眺めながらゆったりと良い時間が過ごせそうです。 問題点としては、自分の場合は留め具を一番下の段に合わせて丁度いい位置に来ました。 （写真１番目と２番目。時計：ロレックスミルガウス、ケース径41mm、手首の外周約19cm） 三段目以上の段だと時計がちょっと下の位置にずれてかっこ悪くなってしまいます。 （写真３番目と4番目。） なので、時計のベルトや留め具の長さによっては、時計を丁度良い位置に合わせられない、 といった不具合が生じるということは、もしかしたら考えられるかもしれません。 あと他の人が書いているように、ケースがもっと大きい、いわゆる「デカ厚」の時計だと 文字盤が木の枠をはみ出してしまうでしょう。 あと、上下に角度を変えられる作りになっていればもっとよかった。 （さすがにそこまでやるともっと高額になってしまうでしょうけど・・・）",positive,ja

"I really really want to give this place more than 2 stars because I have been to other locations and liked them quite a bit. And truthfully the food was quite good. However the service was severely, SEVERELY lacking.\n\nPositives: Like I said, food was good. Drinks were brought promptly, etc. etc.\n\nNegatives: Our waitress. She said she was new, so maybe the blame should ultimately be placed on the management for lack of adequate training. First off, we had a table of 7 and she said for tables of 8 or more they don't do separate checks. So when we repeated that we only had 7 at our table, she still gave us attitude about having to split checks. I know it's a pain in the butt but no one in our party had cash.... Then she forgot a few of our drinks. They were brought promptly but when you forget a few, and also forget the waters we ordered and never come back to check on us again until you bring our food out, we may have a problem. So 2 people we were with went about 20 minutes without drinks while the rest of us were sipping our beer and wine (and missing our waters.) When we went to order our food, a guy we were with asked what came on his sandwich and she replied \""well you can read can't you?\"" Um. Ok. Then our food came out. We ate it, liked it, and then sat there for about a half hour after we had all finished eating. We were upstairs and there was almost nobody else up there so I'm not sure why it took so long for her to come back and pick up our plates (or ask us if we wanted more drinks?) She finally came back and we asked for the checks, she brought them and we paid. And then sat there again for about a half hour. At this point we were all super frustrated. It took a bartender to realize how long we'd been sitting there and he finally came and took care of our checks. UGH.\n\nAll in all, I love there food and that they cater so well to us gluten free folk. But I probably won't be back to this location for a while.",negative,en

Больше сюда никогда не придем. \nЗашли только потому что очень хотели есть и очень любим вьетнамскую кухню.\nДумали покушаем и видом на море насладимся с 4 этажа торгового центра.\n\nВо-первых: не умеют готовить, это невозможно есть, на картинке одно, а по факту выносят другое. Овощи несвежие, протухший сыр, зелень вся вялая, отвратительно! Какие-то непонятные напитки в банках и даже они просрочены…\nПопросили сделать лимонад, нам он не понравился, какой-то с горчинкой непонятной. В итоге на наш отзыв о лимонаде, который мы говорили официанту отреагировал какой-то человек, который, когда мы заходили в это «чудесное» заведение, лежал на диване в неадекватном состоянии, а именно он сказал: «Если хотите попить «лимонадики» и нормально поесть, то вы ошиблись этажом». Что-то вроде этого он произнес запинаясь и путаясь в своих же словах. Мы удивились.😅\n\nВо-вторых: насколько я понял, что это либо учредитель ресторана, либо администрация ресторана, так как он раздавал задания персоналу заведения, зовут его , вроде бы Сергеем. Еще сложилось впечатление, что он нетрадиционной ориентации… такое ощущение было, что он был совсем не пол алкогольным опьянением.\n\nВ-третьих: чуть позже пришел его друг и в дня они устроили черт пойми что. Стали орать на персонал, вести себя как какие-то животные, к этому времени мы только слышали визги этих людей, так как заходили в лифт, зная, что больше мы сюда никогда не придем.\n\nВ-четвертых: оказалось, что эти люди нарушают общественные правила, нарушают покой граждан Ялты, орут и включают музыку поздней ночью и ранним утром, на замечания своих соседей не реагируют, а охране торгового центра «Фонтан», в котором они размещены, по всей видимости, все равно. \nПрошу принять меры в отношении этого юридического лица.",negative,ru

"Maybe we just got the worst room in the hotel, but our stay was awful. The climate control was terrible-- our room was constantly stuffy, humid and warm, until we finally turned the thermostat down to 66, which made it too cold but at least a little less humid. The coffee maker broke on the first day; when we asked for a new one, they delivered one and left it, in the box, on the dresser. They didn't open the box, unpack it, set it up, or take away the old one (we had to do all that). Trash was left lying outside our room for over 24 hours even though the maid had cleaned the room in the meantime. There wasn't enough storage (only two small drawers). And, the room was incredibly noisy-- water noise from surrounding bathrooms woke us up every night. I wouldn't stay here again.",negative,en

The breakfast was quite pleasant in the morning and we appreciated the fine service. The hotel needs a complete make over before we will consider this hotel in the future.",positive,en

The front desk staff were very sweet, almost to a fault. As a group of guys were loudly gathering for a night on the town in the lobby, drinking out of Solo cups and playing the piano, the front desk seemed too meek to intervene. It just made the hotel look more like a frat house and less of a classy downtown hotel, that I know it has the potential to be.

When we returned from our all day adventure in San Antonio - we discovered the air conditioning wouldn't adjust despite many attempts in many ways to adjust it - we ended up closing vents just so we didn't freeze ourselves out (it was too hot to turn it off completely). The living room TV didn't work with any of the 3 remotes in the suite and the light over the stove didn't work. It would not have done any good to report it when we noticed it because it was about 11 p.m. I did report it the next morning - and was offered only 2000 Marriott points for our trouble.

When we went to the room it was apparent someone had been smoking in it and there was a ozone machine still in the room. We went to the desk to ask for another room and were given the room that originally seperated our two rooms (which were adjoining). Why weren't we given these to begin with? At check out there was an adjustment on our bill and during the process the Front Office Supervisor did not say ONE word to us. No how are you, thank you or sorry.

"We ended up with this hotel through a Priceline request of 3 star hotels.
This was NOT a 3 star hotel. We understood that New York City prices are generally way out of whack with what you get elsewhere, but the hotel seems to be pretty run down.
Having read other reviews we heard they were amidst renovations, so we tried to get a revamped room. The first room was a sardine can, so we moved to a room with 2 beds (my wife and I slept apart because the beds were so small). The updated room seemed to have a slightly newer bathroom, but not much else.
Problems we had:
- strange smell in room
- screaming kids across hall (not hotel's fault) but since the halls are so small and walls thin, you can hear alot.
- window shade didn't go down letting sunlight in early
- weak shower pressure
On the bright side - the staff was very courteous and the location is good for tourists.
Long and short - DON'T USE PRICELINE FOR HOTELS. We ended up checking out a night early b/c the hotel was so beneath our expectations (and what we paid for), and Priceline has given us nothing but trouble with customer service. Their ratings for hotels have no merit, and their treatment of customers is beneath terrible.",negative,en

And it's just.... it just never seems worth it to push through all the people for a drink.

"We stayed at this property for 3 nights during August 05 and had no problems. I give it 3 stars because that is what it was, just average. The rate wasn’t that great but the rooms were nice and the location was FANTASTIC! You were pretty much were within walking distance of a lot of attractions and if you weren’t, there are 2 trolley stations very close.
We were picked up at the airport by the shuttle w/i 20 minutes of calling which was nice. It’s only about an 8-10 minute ride to the hotel. The downside of the shuttle was it started at 5am and we had to be at the airport before then so we had to pay for a cab. I didn't like that they would take us to the airport earlier in the shuttle so it ended up a $10 cab ride with tip.
We lucked out and got a huge corner room so space was not a problem at all. The bathrooms were fine and I didn’t have any problems with the shower (i.e. low pressure, cold).
They have a full breakfast that is included every morning which was very good and fast. The only problem is the place is packed during peak eating hours and a table is hard to find. They had a full spread of hot and cold foods.
There is also a manager’s reception everyday from 5:30-7:30 which was very good also. They had snacks and drinks. The section of alcohol was more then I have seen at most other hotels also. They had a beer, wine and some different liquor. This is also something that got packed but the line went fast.
I would say that the concierge was the worst thing about the trip. She was pretty useless. It seemed like the places she suggested were not even close to what we were asking for. At one point we asked for a sports bar and she must have been getting a kickback from this bar because she sent us to a bar that had sports on TV but wasn’t even close to a sports bar. She also told me the hotel bar was a sports bar so after that I didn't give her much credit. The people at the front desk were just as helpful as she was.
Since we were there during the summer the place was packed. The bellboy told me they were 90-100% booked during the summer. Sometime you had to stand there and wait 5 minutes for an elevator but there was a sign they were starting an elevator renovation if thats going to make a difference I dont know.
Overall it was an average stay. If someone asked would I stay there again I think I would if they had better rates but if not I think I would pick another hotel in the area.",positive,en

"Randomly Turns Off
These were pretty easy to set up and easily integrate with my Amazon Echos. However, every one of them randomly turns off as if there’s a momentary short or something. I’ll be watching TV sometimes for hours sometimes for a few minutes then the power will suddenly cut out before immediately coming back on. Even when I’m not actively using the things plugged up to them, I can hear them clicking on and off periodically. I never have an issue turning them on or off when I want to, but it’s really annoying having them randomly turn off when I didn’t turn them off. I’d mostly recommend these for functions that don’t require them to remain on for extended periods of time.",neutral,en

"My company and i have been at the south loop hotel for a few weeks now and during my experience here I have been locked out of my room on a daily occurance which I dealt with at first then it had gotten out of hand when hours have gone by without us getting into our room. The hotel staff tried bribing us with free pizza for the inconvienance and a great review of there staff and security but the facts show that this hotel is one to stay away from there service and hospitality are the of the most ignorance that I have ever seen traveling with the government of the united states of America. During my stay here I've been bribed by the hotel staff and security, I've been locked out of my room on a daily occurance for hours, the hotel is infested with spiders and cockroaces which I had founded out during the last several days here. The motels staff was switching our rooms but no matter what room you stay in there is a problem with each such as the locks dont work or the air conditioning doesn't work or the room is infestested with spiders, the hotel is also infested with hookers. I had never been more humiliated during my stay here with the hotel staff trying to set me up with prostitutes.

"I stayed here for four nights in June 2012. I was attending a meeting at the Hyatt next door and this one of the nearest places to the Hyatt and inexpensive.
I am a vegetarian and usually carry some frozen food with me. I needed to microwave it. Now as per hotel staff on duty on most nights I cannot use the only microwave in the breakfast room. However on some days some very helpful and attentive staff at the front desk were available. So there you are.. if you are lucky you would get helpful staff otherwise you have had it.
The WiFi is also very poor in signal strength and I had to use the computer in the lobby for my internet access. However the computer's monitor had a focus problem and most text on it was kind of fuzzy. I wiped my eyeglasses and still they were fuzzy. I called a fellow guest nearby and he confirmed that the problem was indeed the monitor and not my eyes or the spectacles!
The location of course is great with Union station right across. The shuttle service is also very helpful to go around.
I feel this hotel has great promise if only the management decides to overhaul a few glaring deficiencies.",neutral,en

"We booked four days stay at this hotel for the site for family of four.
When we arrived there, there was no one help us with the luggage. The valet attendant was not interested in helping us since we are not paying $35 a day for the valet parking. We had to lug all luggage ourselves to 12th floor lobby.
The check in was quick and friendly and we were arranged to the premier floor at 24th floor.
The bedroom had two comfortable beds. It also has a sleeper sofa in the living room. But the living room is very narrow and once the sleeper is open, there is no room to walk around. The fridge cabinet was bolt shut with no way to open it. The TV in the living room was awkward placed and it is hard to see it from the sofa. It did provide free water in the room.
The furniture looks worn. The TV in the bed room was old 27 in CRT instead of LCD.
However, it did have a relative large shower/toilet room, but a single sink was room on the hallway.
Overall, it feel cramped and worn. It did have a partial view to the San Diego Convention Center at San Diego bay between two tall building.
One of the phone with remote handset was broken that I can not call the front desk from it.
If you want to use the internet, you have to pay 10 a night, which is outrageous. But you can go downstair at lobby to get free slow wifi. It did have four free computers for looking up the information and browse the internet.
The swimming pool was small and the gym is cramped though it has a lot of walking machines.
There is a little gift shop at the lobby which is very convenient for emergency stuff.
Regarding to parking, there are free off street parking overnight between 6pm - 8am, but you need to watch out the street cleaning day. You can also park at self-prepaid parking lot with price range from $13 to $7 depends on the location. However, it allows for only 10 hours of continuous parking. Hotel valet parking is $35 but you may have to going around several floors to find the spot (makes you dizzy going around).
Only half of the building is hotel rooms and the rest are offices and San Diego Symphony hall.
It is about 6 blocks from GasLamp districts, and most of the street around the area are pretty deserted. But the area around Gas Lamp districts has a lot of people, bars and shops and is 10 minutes walk from it.
There is free WSJ, USA Today and San Diego newspaper at lobby but not by the door.
One thing I found was pretty annoying was that on check out, we were told we own nothing, and we did not get bill under the door for hassle free check out. But when I went home, I found they tagged $21 on my credit card. I had to call them to correct it.
Overall, my impression of the stay was OK. I chose it because of its downtown location and fancy outside, but it was not what it cracks up to be.",neutral,en

"I can hardly believe that this inert, turgid and badly staged film is by a filmmaker whose other works I've quite enjoyed. The experience of enduring THE LADY AND THE DUKE (and no other word but ""enduring"" will do), left me in a vile mood, a condition relieved only by reading the IMDb user comment by ali-112. For not only has Rohmer attempted (with success) to make us see the world through the genre art of 18th century France but, as ali has pointed out, has shown (at the cost of alienating his audience) the effects of both class consciousness and the revolution it inspired through the eyes of a dislikably elitist woman of her times. The director has accomplished something undeniably difficult, but I question whether it was worth the effort it took for him to do so -- or for us to watch the dull results of his labor.",negative,en

"The area around the hotel is full of homeless people and although there are designer shops just down the road it's still not a nice place to be walking about. Otherwise, the location itself was handy for getting most places.
The room itself was nice but we had a few issues. I'm allergic to feather bedding, which isn't an uncommon complaint but although the hotel were able to offer polyester pillows they didn't have any duvets to replace the feather one so it was taken away and we were given a couple extra blankets which weren't as warm and we ended up having to sleep with the heating on which wasn't ideal.
The toilet took forever to flush and you had to hold the push button down for a good ten seconds for it to kick in.
The door to the bathroom had no handle, just a recess in it to pull it forward and back to open. It wasn't the easiest to handle, especially for those with nicely manicured hands. I could also see this as a problem for those with dexterity problems. It's also easy to push it too far open and then it becomes stuck in the recess and is a nuisance to try and get back out.
The room was a little bit scruffy around the edges - some of the light fittings had bits hanging off which isn't what you expect from a hotel that advertises itself as a boutique hotel. The chest of drawers was also sitting unevenly, so everytime you opened one drawer another rolled out and you had to push umpteen drawers in until you hit the right combination to get them all to stay closed again which was annoying.
As far as noise was concerned, we were on the 8th floor and it wasn't an issue although we did sleep with the windows closed because of the duvet problem. Perhaps in warmer weather this might have been an issue.
On the plus side:
A store (walgreens, I think) right next door which was handy for any refreshments, toiletries etc.
Lovely big full length mirror with a plug point beside it to get ready in the main bedroom as well as a nice bathroom mirror with plugpoint as well.
Super comfortable bed.
Spotlessly clean.
The towncar to the airport is a fab service and was a nice treat at the end of our honeymoon for not much more than what we would have paid for a cab, The driver was a lovely guy.

On one occasion, I went with a friend during a Penguins playoff game. It was crowded, but not excessively so. Since no tables at the bar were available and all the stools were taken, we stood near the bar and waited. It was next to impossible to get any of the bartenders to respond to order drinks. We ran into some other friends who were sitting at the bar and had requested more beers and had been waiting for 20 minutes for their drinks. I had another similar experience when the bar was not crowded; the bartenders just seem to not be interested in serving customers. In both cases it seemed like they were more interested in talking to their friends or flirting with regulars. \n\nI'll go back for the restaurant, but never again for the bar.",negative,en

"Went here during Memorial Day weekend and waited a long time in guest list line, which I expected so I'm not complaining. The venue is nice-looking - very upscale, but it's tiny! Their little \""dance floor\"" area is right in front of the dinky DJ booth, which is located on the way to the bathroom. If you have to pee, you either walk all the way around, or fight through that crowded dance floor of sweaty and wet people. I understand that it was a busy weekend, but even if it wasn't busy, there still isn't much room to move around.\n\nTheir floors are super wet too, and they do a horrible job keeping it safe. I saw multiple people slipping and eating shit. They weren't even running. Safety hazard.\n\nThey make you check in your bag, and charge you a lot for it.\nA margarita cost $44, and it wasn't even that strong.\nToo many rules - no splashing, no bringing drinks into the pool (so if we drink alcohol and get dehydrated, we can't go in the pool unless we finish our drink?) and you can't place your belongings near the plants because it will crush them. They really pay employees to guard their plants and move towels that were touching them. \n\nSo while I did have fun because I was with a fun group of people, it was kind of annoying having a guy blow his whistle throughout the entire event. Also, people who went there also seemed a bit more uptight than at other Vegas pool parties.

"My husband and I stayed at the Sheraton City Center last weekend for him to attend a conference...I tagged along as I had never been to Indy before. The lobby was spacious and attractive, with several comfortable chairs both alone and in groups (which was important since the free wifi could only be used in the lobby). The desk staff was overwhelmed with so many people checking in at the same time, but despite the lines, they remained cheerful and helpful. As we checked in, I jokingly asked if they would like to give us the honeymoon suite for the same price as the room we had booked, and was amazed when our clerk searched and did upgrade us to a suite for the same price!
Our suite was great! Large, spacious rooms on the 20th floor, attractively decorated . The living area had a comfortable chair and sofa and large flatscreen TV with HD satellite channels, and a wetbar with microwave and small fridge and coffeemaker with Starbucks coffee. Large double doors closed off the bedroom, which had a very comfortable king sized bed, another chair with ottoman, desk, and TV. The bath area featured a huge vanity in the bedroom and another smaller sink and vanity in the tub area. One thing I really appreciated was the lighting----the vanity lights were bright and their were lamps everywhere you would want them----something that is often skimped on in hotels. I hate a dark room, or one where you can't read because the lamps are too dim or not where you want them.
The location was perfect for exploring downtown---just a block away from monument circle, a few blocks from the capital and museums, with restaurants and shopping all close enough that we did not move the car once we checked in.
On the business side, my husband reported that the conference rooms were comfortable and easily accomodated the large number of people and various meetings that were being help with his convention.
The only negative comments I have are that the free wifi was only available in the lobby, not in the room, and that it was not working for most of our stay. Also, we could hear a lot of street noise in our room----sirens, horns, etc. And, we had to pay $23 a night for parking in the garage.

I saw stir fry pickled chinese mustard that really intrigued me. It's one of my favorite homestyle dish. But I'll save that for a solo meal because it has an acquired taste.\n\nOh and their taro coconut tapioca drink is yummy. It reminds me of a taro dessert my mom would make. It's creamy, coconut milk with taro chunks, sweetened and with little clear tapioca pearls. \n\n*Also, their menu stated that they will cook fresh raw seafood for you. You just have to bring in the receipt alongside. It's $5 each dish and you can choose from a long list of sauces/styles you would like to have it prepared. Very convienent with Mekong Market across the street. Yummm... I think I may have to return with a lobster to have them make me lobster with gravy over e fu noodles.",neutral,en

"You've go to be kidding me. Through no choice of my own, I was made to stay at this joke of a hotel. First off, the website falsely advertises the hotel rooms. Aside, from a small part of the hotel in Tower 3 that has been renovated and looks like the pictures on the website, the rest of the hotel is old, run down and filthy. The toilets were leaking and there was even an empty beer can on the floor of one of the rooms. My roommates and I switched 3 times, before settling into the 4th room on the renovated side of the hotel. Problem with the final (renovated) room: 2 double beds for 3 women. Additionally, the bathroom didn't have a ventilation system, so expect a stuffy, humid, sometimes not so fresh-smelling bathroom and a sink practically over the toilet and the room was ridiculously small. Also, don't look so close because these rooms are not that clean either. As for the unrenovated rooms...yellow sheets, stains on the carpet, marks on walls, dirty windows. A motel would've been an upgrade.
Neighborhood: be careful at night! (ps- I'm a New Yorker so not a lot frightens me)
As for the hospitality, I did not care for it at all.
Finally, My perfume went missing somewhere during one of the moves and was ""recovered"" a day later only after I made an accusation of theft.
Saving Grace: Should you have to stay at this hotel (for ex, because a tornado blew away all the other hotels in San Francisco), then try the Cucumber Martini at the hotel bar. Ask for it, it's not on the menu, but any of the bartenders will make it for you.
Had it not been for the conference, I would've checked out immediately. I'm never staying here again.

"Bad Movie! Bad! Go stand in a discount bin. Carrot Top should really stick to low lit comedy clubs. It's movies like this that make old Jerry Lewis films look like Shakespeare and John Agar like John Barrymore. Coutney Thorne-Smith (a fine talent)is absolutely wasted. Her purpose seems mainly to look pretty and oblivious. The only enjoyable things about the movie is seeing Raquel Welch doing an Alexis Carrington type role, and Estelle Harris as a harridan of a landlady. The only way I can imagine someone thinking it would be a good idea to make this (beyond sophomoric) film, is if the producers' fourth grade child was allowed to pick the script. Well, maybe his third grader. What this film really needs is to be rubbed in the noses of its creators.",negative,en

"Stay 4+1 night in this hotel in october. Overall a very good experience, as I had ambassador status I was upgraded both time to a high floor room, both time very quiete (I'm normally very noise sensitive). Room was very nice and well decorated. Bathroom it's just perfect with the big shower. Wifi was free due to the ambassador status. On the corner of the hotel you have the shake shack who server one of the best burger in town. Time square is just at one block
Now the two negative point for me. Check in was a bit long, the priority desk was closed, nothing unacceptable, but just a little bit annoying after a long intercontinental flight. The main problem occur when I left the hotel only for one night (going to DC and back to NYC at the same hotel) I ask the hotel if they can keep the luggages. They told me that for security issue (close to time square) they can't store luggage's (I will not discuss security rules, but what is the difference if I keep the room and store them inside?), and they have only a external solution (Schwarz Storage) near Penn Station open from 8 to 11 pm. I ask the concierge if they have another solution as my train was at 7am so before the opening hours, but they told me it's the only way, and I should bring the luggage the evening before. It's the first time I use concierge service, and I was expecting something else for this hotel standard (but maybe I have to high expectation). Well, I follow the advice and bring the luggage to the Schwarz location at 10pm the night before. I'm use to the european standard on luggage storage, and I was very surprise when I arrive to the location, a very strange place, dark, looks like a appartement and not like a storage room. They seems to do the pricing base on the face, and they charge me 3 days (actually it was only 48hours) because they does not count the hours but by day. I will NEVER store a expensive luggage their, and I do not understand why a hotel like IC recommend this solution, it's really not at the hotel standard, even backpacker will avoid this place.
I encourage the hotel manager to visit the Schwarz place and realize why the need definitely to find a better solution (I'm sure they often face this luggage storage request) and not sending customer their. Maybe share a storage room with the Barclay.",positive,en

"After an unimpressive visit to Sky Bar at Trader's Hotel to celebrate my partner's birthday, we decided to visit to Marini's on 57th. Took a taxi to Marini's which is located on the 57th floor of a building immediately adjacent to the Mandarin Oriental hotel. Upon entering the building, we had to take three elevator rides (changing elevator banks twice). At the 56th floor, before the final elevator ride to Marini's, we spotted Nobu restaurant and made a mental note to come back and try Nobu's but never did. Maybe next trip? Anyway, we finally got out of the elevator on the 57th floor, and were met by a pleasant but harried restaurant staff member who asked us if we preferred indoor or outdoor seating. We replied ""indoor"" and she led us through the noisy and frenetic premises, which were busy with all the ""beautiful people"" hobnobbing and wanting to be seen. Finally we arrived at a table and were given drink menus, at which point, the staff member promptly disappeared. Only then did we look around and realize that this was actually an outdoor table. The truncated view of a portion of one of the Petronas towers immediately adjacent was interesting, and a different perspective, but we were not really too impressed. We decided on our drinks, and were waiting for a waitress to show up to take our order, when a couple of gentlemen sat at the next table and lit up cigars. Now, I have smoked a few stogies in my day, but we were just not in the mood to sit there inhaling what to us was malodorous second-hand cigar smoke. So, after about 5 more minutes of waiting fruitlessly for a waitress, and enduring smelly cigar smoke, we decided to just pack it in and leave, which we did. Not an impressive experience at all. Now that we have been to both Sky Bar and Marini's on 57th, we will not care to revisit either. ""Been there, done that."" Just not impressed. Maybe our expectations were too high?",neutral,en
I had booked the flight to and from Nassau in November for travel for March 15 to 22. The government advised people of not travelling outside of Canada on March 13. Around this time airlines began to revise their refund policy. I had completed a online form for Sunwing at their request due to a high call volume when the government made a stronger advisory about not going outside of Canada. The form was notice of cancellation. When I contacted Sunwing after 2 days of trying to call Sunwing I was advised that I would only be getting a travel voucher for future use because the flight was on the 15 and not the 17th or later. The dates make no sense. I wanted and should have gotten a full refund. Sunwing is temporarily suspends all operations on March 23.,negative,en

"This airline is truly awful, and truly incompetent. They don't care. And they're unscrupulous and disingenuous, aka crooks. I flew to Vallarta from SFO via Mexico City. Outbound was an hour late. They changed my connection flight despite our arriving on time for me to make the original connection. Had a four hour layover as a result. All of that was inconvenient, but within the realm of airline travel in our times. The real issue was the return. I checked in online, had my boarding passes, arrived on time and was ready to board. When I checked in at the desk, they told me I was bumped because of a ""credit card problem."" The roundtrip had been fully paid for and posted two months prior so I knew that was nonsense. I argued, pleaded, used logic and my fluent Spanish. I called for the manager all to no avail. Ten stoic employees observing my rancor, nothing. Long story short, I had to buy a one-way return on another airline (no way was I going to reward bad behavior by rebooking with them). Another day in Vallarta on the weekend and another night of hotel are not the end of the world, but my nerves and usual motto of ""assuming good intentions"" in people took a hit. It's tragic that the flagship carrier of a nation of otherwise good and honest people should be marred by the actions of the few. Luckily, I had paid with credit card that treated me like a customer and refunded me 50% of the fare, but still. Caveat emptor.",negative,en

"Bo Derek will not go down in history as a great actress. On the other hand, starting in the 1980s, actual acting talent seemed to be less and less of a required ability in Hollywood, so Bo could very well have gone onto bigger and better things after the big box office take of Blake Edwards' ""10."" That is if she hadn't allowed her husband, John Derek, to take over her career. Numerous Playboy spreads and bad movies like this one (this one in particular) directed by John destroyed what momentum she had and made her the butt of many a joke. In the 1980s it was assumed that you could put a certain personality in a certain movie and it would be box office gold. John figured that putting Bo in a movie wherein she was nude for much of the running time would make people flock to the theaters after the 10 hype. Maybe if the movie had been any good perhaps. This version of Tarzan has got to be the all time worst of the many iterpretations of Burrough's lord of the jungle, a slap in the face to character's book and film legacy. Tarzan is in fact an after thought as the film is primarily a vehicle for Bo's breasts and Richard Harris' wonderful over acting (remember, the pair had worked together in Orca). His scenery chewing helps you to stay awake during the boredom of it all and yes, the film is quite boring. Nothing really exciting happens and the few action scenes seem to have been shot by someone in a trance. Bo's body can only get you so far. Miles O'Keeffe who played Tarzan at least would go onto a long and enjoyable B movie career and Richard Harris can put this behind him after his recent acting triumphs, but Bo and John Derek never recovered from this fiasco and future collaborations between the two only served to show why his directing career and her acting career died in the first place.And how did the orangutan get to Africa?",negative,en

"In terms of price and room size, the signature is a no-brainer. You can regularly get 900sqft 1br's for just over $100/night. This coming with full kitchen (with large fridge. Def make a drink/snack run beforehand), two bathrooms, balcony, a king size bed and a pull out queen bed in the main room. Sick. The rooms are modern and have desks, FREE WIFI and adjustable flat screens (make sure to tune to the last channel!)\n\nYou can walk to the Wet Republic (although there are 3 pools at The Signature) and the MGM restaurant area in about 5 min using the moving walkways. So, is it on the strip? Nope. But it's mighty close to the MGM. Anything else requires a cab ride. There are plenty of cabs on premises so don't be worried. \n\nThere are 3 towers, each with their own check-in/out, valets and bellhops. Tower one has a Starbucks and a bar lounge, Tower two has an awesome deli and I've yet to venture into tower tre. This is the place to stay if you're looking to catch a good nights sleep while raging in the Vegas.",neutral,en

"That is exactly what happened to me at the Radisson hotel located at 11350 LBJ @ Jupiter, Dallas, Texas 75238. On the evening of June 9, 2012 ,after going to watch my daughter graduate from college around 9:00. I returned to the hotel to find that someone had came into my room and robbed me of everything i owned. I noticed there was no forced entry so i knew that someone had a key. I walked down to the front desk and approached the gentleman at the desk and ask him who all had a access to my room he replied ""no one"". I explained to him my situation.then went back to my room to call the police. After I phoned the police i went back down to see if they had surveilence he replied only in the entrance/exits and front desk. Then he proceeded to tell me that he had made a terrible mistake and gave a key to my room to a young woman that he had seen me talk to in the lobby the day before.

No complaints at all and it was delicious.\n\nSecond time was on my lunch break at work. I asked for the same again (creature of habit) but this time they didn't have any brie. I was a little saddened by this, but i prompted them for substitute suggestions and we decided upon mozzarella. It wasn't the same but still tasty.\n\nIt is pretty much like most sandwich shops, they the staff are lovely and friendly, prices are fair (panini was \u00a32.85) and there is a wide selection to choose from.

"Beltane is a really fascinating flurry of dance, partial nudity (all very tasteful and significant in meaning of course) and general celebration. It's also a pyromaniac's dream, what with all the fire waving that goes on during the evening. I came along to Beltane for the first time last year, and had very little idea what to expect, well aside from the fact people would be swigging away at whatever potent mixture they could find, but this is of course, standard for any Scottish festivity. \n\nThe festival takes place on the striking and very scenic Calton Hill, so before the event even started, the atmosphere was set by the environment, and it got really exciting as the crowds started to build in anticipation of a bit of pagan revelry. The actual festival is a traditional procession, to welcome in the spring, and to celebrate the fertility of the earth. The procession really is something to see, and the beginning of the event, with the drum beats and obligatory lashings of fire, was truly striking. The procession then goes through various stages, of ritual dancing and celebration, which you follow round the hill, although I think it's easier to follow properly when you've been to the festival a few times, as I ended up getting a bit lost in the crowd. Clear some space for the 30th April, you'll enjoy it.",neutral,en

"This is a very good trail for hikers of all levels, which is why we almost always take our out-of-town guests here rather than some other trails around town. Parking is easy (except perhaps for some very busy windows), no special equipment or even fancy shoes are really required, and the scene is a very good showcase of Arizona beauty. You can run it, walk it, or take it in at a leisurely pace.\n\nWhile there are just a couple of steep sections mostly at the start, the climb isn't rough at all and the trail is very well established. It's fairly wide throughout, so it accommodates a couple of people in each direction. It is a \""there and back\"" rather than a loop, which is actually nice for people who may not want to make the whole trek or for less active hikers that may tire more easily. While you may encounter some runnners, most people know proper trail etiquette (we all know there are some party poopers out there but they are few and far between). \n\nThe only feature I wish were different is the dog policy. With the popularity of the trail, I understand the restriction and it is easier to keep clean this way, but I do miss my four-legged friends. For being a quick drive from town, this is a terrific go-to hike.",neutral,en

I booked another flight to Mombasa and I immediately contacted Kenya Airways customer support to find a solution for my return flight.

When I went to Mombasa airport to fly back they could not find my ticket. I showed them the email with the confirmation and the Kenya Airways lady in Mombasa agreed that it said my ticket was confirmed. Head office refused to let me onboard unless I purchased a new ticket. I did so to come home to my family and I was advised to contact customer service when I got back to get my money back. Then followed several months where I have been writing with Kenya Airways Customer Support. All sort of excuses came up claiming I had the wrong visa, to me being a student and other lies. Finally they concluded that in reality I had not purchased a new ticket, instead I had paid a penalty fee for missing my original flight. I then provided Kenya Airways with a copy of my receipt from Mombasa airport that clearly states that I had to my a new ticket. Since then Kenya Airways have ignored my emails. I am really shocked how Kenya Airways has tried to avoid taking responsibility and done so by lying, bullying and inventing stories to make me drop my claim. I followed every procedure the moment I missed my plane and I truly trusted and believed Kenya Airways when they wrote me that my ticket was confirmed. The lesson learned is apparently that you cannot trust Kenya Airways.",negative,en

"We stayed at the hotel 15-18 September 2007 and paid £200 per night for a club room on the 36th floor.
The room was fine the beds were very comfortable the only thing missing was a mirror in the bedroom.
We had a couple of problems the main one being that the pool was closed for refurbishment while we were there and we had not been told in advance. The second was we wanted to use the business centre for online check in of our return flight which opened at 6.15pm but the business centre closes at 6pm and we were told to use the internet cafe round the corner. We did but felt the hotel should have offered the use of their facilities. The staff did not go out of their way to be helpful.
Overall the hotel was good and in a great location for sightseeing/shopping however the staff/service was at best average.",negative,en

"My husband & I recently stayed in the Morningside Inn. We had originally booked a double room but had a friend who decided to accompany us. My husband emailed the given email address 4 times and did not receive a response, I then rang and spoke to Patrick, the manager, who agreed we could stay in a triple room and 'amended' our booking.
When we arrived, we were told that we had to stay in one specific room overnight and to change the next day, by another staff member (not Patrick). After a 7 hour flight and 1 hour train ride into Manhattan, we were all looking forward to a hot shower, but as per the previous reviews, no hot water.... My husband made a complaint to the lady at the front desk and was told they were 'fixing the boiler' and it would be fine tomorrow. Needless to say, we did not have a proper shower until we got back to London.
Next day, we try to check in to our new room only to be told by Patrick that he had no idea of the amendment to the booking and he had just rented his last triple room. When my husband explained his displeasure, stating that the receptionist on the previous day had confirmed that we would be staying in the same room, just on a different floor, he was told by Patrick that he had an 'attitude' and that we should all shut up and let him talk. He was very rude and arrogant.
I would not recommend staying in this establishment unless you feel like being abused on your holiday. There are better hotels (with hot water and no bedbugs) for a little bit more money closer to the center of Manhattan.",negative,en

"We noticed that our favorite brand of Vietnamese coffee, Trung Nguyen, is served here; and it was a main reason for our first visit. The coffee was prepared the way we enjoyed it in Vietnam. Then we ordered a fresh orange juice… all was perfect, including the friendly staff. After several coffee only visits, we decided to eat here.Please note that it is not the upscale restaurant, it is rather a very simple but authentic eatery located on the 3rd floor next to the other simple eateries. We have very strict dietary requirements, so we created a few screen shots in Malay, simplified Chinese and Vietnamese languages what should be skipped in our food.That was a smart move that helped to resolve the communication gap. Fried Beancurd Chien gion – was OK, but not my favorite. Sup chay vegetable soup – we enjoyed it. Goi cuon chay (4 big spring rolls served with the peanut sauce) – will come back just for this.Café Nong - excellent, as usual. If you do not have any dietary restrictions, or at least less than we have, then you find plenty of choices. Tip: we always order juices without sugar and ice. And for the Vietnamese coffee (Café Nong ) we ask to put ½ of the normal portion of the condensed milk, otherwise all will be too sweet. Enjoy the food and friendly service!

"Visited NYC with friends last year and stayed at the Ace. When we arrived it turned out that they were overbooked and that they had placed us in a bigger room (we've booked the bunk bed room). I must admit, we got a little excited. Turned out for all the wrong reasons. The room was tiny, without a doubt the smallest room I've ever stayed in. And that for 300 dollar a night ! We could barely move around. The interior was great though. Loved the old style door to the bathroom.
The staff was okay, a bit snobby but not unfriendly. It has a very good coffee bar (Stumptown) which I knew from their (temporarily) Amsterdam location. And I was pleasantly surprised by the Breslin, the restaurant attached to the Ace Hotel. They serve great food and home brewed beer.

Well it has potential but that is nowhere near being achieved.

With no other option in town, we went to the hotel where I checked in to the higher rate. At 10pm, there was NO food available anywhere at the facility including a bar that was open and no vending machines with snacks. For $200, the room was not good - pretty much a $50 room. Filth and food behind night stands, wallpaper peeling off kids area, tube TV (didn't know any hotels still had these), nail polish on bathroom walls, stains on light shade, stains on bedspread, water leaking from refrigerator, cup ring on counter (not from us as we only had bottles and this was light a big gulp size cup), and so on. The next morning when we left, there were 2 chairs in the elevator from the youth groups staying there. Obviously little or no security. Then to top it off there were 2 adult males sleeping on sofas in the lobby when we checked out at 7am. Ok, so maybe no security.

以前１着1万円近くするナベシャツを愛用していました。 買い替え時期になり、他のメーカーでいい物がないか探していたところこちらを発見。 お安いので失敗しても、そんなに痛くはないかと購入しました。 1ヶ月程使用(割と酷使)しての感想です。 以前愛用していたナベシャツは、自分のサイズよりワンサイズ下げたものを着用することがおおかったのですが、こちらはサイズそのままでいいと思います。3段階調整できるので、それで十分対応できるかなと。 暑い時期に着用していましたが、通気性はそんなに気にならなかったので特に問題ないかなと思います。 フック式に慣れていなかったので、始めは着脱にストレスを強く感じましたが、慣れてくるとそんなに気になりません。スムーズに着脱できます。 ただ、締め付けている胸の下あたりが痒くなることが多く、不快感は度々ありました。脱いだ後、特に痒くなり、無意識に掻いて、引っかき傷がたくさんできてしまいました… 1ヶ月強の間2着を酷使しましたが、その内1着のフック部分の縫製にほつれが出て引っ掛けることができなくなりました。 酷使したせいだとは思いますが、耐久性はないですね。頻繁に使う方にはあまりオススメ出来ないかもしれません。 たまに使う程度や使い捨てであれば、全然アリだと思います。",neutral,ja

Lorsque nous sommes arrivés vers 18h00 (après un vol long-courrier) en famille, notre chambre n'était pas prête.

"Wow. This place was better than expected!!!\n\nSince I consider myself more of a connoisseur of \""weird\"" foods as well as ethnic cuisines, I am not often excited by American concept foods. I do like uniqueness and thus upon buying a gift certificate to this place wanted to give \""Twisted Farm Food\"" a try....and I'm VERY glad I did!!!\n\nFirst, I am a big atmosphere junkie and Hash House Delivered 5 stars in this category. I liked the contemporary, slightly country decor. I dined here around holiday time, so there was Xmas tree decorated and placed smack in the middle--which added more to the whimsical atmosphere and the modern touches to the place. I liked the huge, modern and slightly utility-like looking tables/chairs and silver metal touches. A++ for decor!\n\nOur appetizers were also rather delicious. Polenta and sirloin dish was extremely appetizing and flavorful! I'm craving it right now! Salad, however, was a bit overpriced and was the only item that was not large in size. I felt that lettuce was a bit wilted and flavors were not as full as they should have been. Very average at best for the salad.\n\nOf course we tried waffles and chicken for dinner!!! This dish was more fun then super delicious, however with the humongous portion sizes and many stalks of sage, I got to love this dish' homey flavors and how can you not like the \""baked in bacon\"" in the huge waffle? \n\nAroma around the place was delicious! Think bacon mixed with sage. Yum. (I liked how all dishes had a similar sage decoration, it was very weird, but in a good, unique way).\n\nService was superb! Probably the best I've ever had. Not hovering over the table and interrupting, but being sweet and always quick with refills, recommendations and plate service.\n\nI will definitely be back to this place! I do suggest sharing meals, and even with the extra plate fee (often waived), you will leave filled and even have left overs!",neutral,en

"We booked this hotel as we were told it’s the best available close to convention center. When I read Tripadvisor reviews, I knew I should not expect much at all. However it's worse than I thought, the hotel was so old and you did not even feel it's clean. Speaking of service, well, they forgot to put shampoo and container in my room for two straight days. When I tried to call, my room phone (which looked dusty) did not work and I had to make the call with my cell. Worst part of all was that at around 5:30am every morning, there was a huge noisy outside of my window lasting for about 15 minutes (sounded like a tractor was picking up the garbage bin on the street). I called front desk to check out what's going on but never got an answer. A couple of my colleagues complained how unclean their rooms were, so I guess it's not just me who had a bad experience. The only thing positive about this hotel is the location which is within walking distance to convention center and inner harbor. However I will never go back for this reason.",negative,en

"Gute Gartenleuchten mit schönem Effekt
Diese Leuchten habe ich mir für den Garten besorgt und möchte Sie gerne an Weihnachten verbauen. Technik: - Die Leuchten sind sehr einfach aufgebaut und es ist alle enthalten was benötigt wird. - Betrieben werden die Leuchten über Solar, es wird tagsüber ein Akku aufgeladen, der über Nacht die Leds mit Strom versogt. - Die Solarbox besitzt eine Taste mit 2 Stellungen (Aus / Dämmerungsschaltung) Verarbeitung: - Der verwendete Kunststoff ist nicht der hochwertigste und leider deshalb vermutlich auch nicht sehr UV Beständig. - Die Gehäuse der Leds bestehen aus sehr dünnem Plexiglas und sind deshalb vermutlich nicht zu 100% wasserdicht.

"Vor ein paar Jahren waren mein Cousin und ich das erste mal im American Diner. Sind immer nur mit dem Auto vorbeigefahren, aber da es von au\u00dfen so aussieht wie die Diner in den USA, hatten wir beschlossen da mal hinzugehen. Als uns die nette Bedienung die Karte brachte und dort irgendwo stand, dass das Diner zur Alten Schmiede geh\u00f6rt, waren die Bedenken weg, wie es wohl in der K\u00fcche aussieht. Und damals war der Burger und der Burrito wirklich lecker! Mayonnaise und Ketchup gibt es aus Flaschen am Tisch gratis so viel man m\u00f6chte. Fr\u00fcher gab es nur 0,2l Fl\u00e4schchen Cola. Aber dennoch, es hat geschmeckt und der Preis war daf\u00fcr in Ordnung.\n\n\n Anfang diesen Jahres waren wir voller Vorfreude auf einen leckeren Burger wieder da. Die auch hier wieder sehr nette Bedienung brachte schnell die Karte, notierte sich flink unsere Bestellung und nach angemessener, relativ kurzer Wartezeit kam dann auch das essen. LEIDER war der Burger alles andere als lecker. Die Pommes waren wie immer super, und auch die gratis Mayonnaise und Ketchupflasche standen noch da. (nicht die von vor ein paar Jahren, sondern frische) Der Geschmack und die Konsistenz vom Burger waren alles andere als das, was wir vom American Diner gew\u00f6hnt waren. Auf die Frage was denn passiert sei, sagte die Bedienung nur: Sparma\u00dfnahmen wegen zu wenig G\u00e4sten?! Immerhin gibt es dort mittlerweile auch gro\u00dfe Getr\u00e4nke mit 0,5l, aber da man haupts\u00e4chlich zum lecker Burger essen da hin geht hilft das nicht \u00fcber den schlechten Burger hinweg.\n\n\n Fazit: hoffentlich kommen wieder mehr Kunden, damit es wieder gute Burger wie fr\u00fcher gibt. Jedoch frage ich mich, wie mehr Kunden kommen sollen, wenn die Burger wie Schuhsolen schmecken... leider, leider haben Sie sich zum schlechten \""Verbessert\""..",negative,en

"My friend and I stayed for one night. We spent less than 12 hours in the hotel, but easily discovered it was overrated and not worth the money (I wouldn't pay more than $50/night, I get better service at Motel 6). We decided to change hotels from lower manhattan to central park and asked same-day of our stay if there were any rooms available. The front desk manager said they were booked solid. Literally 5 minutes later we walked outside and called the helmsley chain asking for available rooms and they quoted us a price of 230 at Park Lane and we booked. 10 minutes after being declined we walked back in with a reservation! Why on earth would a desk manager LIE about vacancies? After requesting a non-smoking room, sure enough our room reeks of dingy tobacco with dirty ash trays. We call the front desk to be moved to a non-smoking room. Displaying quite the attitude, he moved us to a new room that was equally abysmal but without the tobacco smell(We learn now that there were at least 2 available rooms as opposed to the zero we were first told about). Upon checkout I asked the concierge about cab fare to LaGuardia. He said it would be about $50, of course after myself directing the cabbie where to go, the TOTAL price of the drive was $22. I have spent less than a week of my life in New York and it seems I am more fit for the concierge position than him! Obviously the Helmsley Park Lane is an island of complete incompetence, unjustified arrogance, and complete ineptness in an otherwise wonderful city. Location was great, but the uppity snootiness and rudeness of the employees seemed to be a futile attempt to compensate for a rubbish hotel, comparable to a holiday inn (which would have bigger rooms I might add). The chic pictures and font on their website is decieving. We stayed at the Hilton in the desolate Ground Zero area of lower manhattan and had a much better experience. The staff at Park Lane made us feel unwelcome and uncomfortable. Quite frankly, I hope the workers at this hotel go out of business and find themselves homeless like the people right outside the door of the hotel's 58th street entrance! Living on the street may help curtail their arrogance. I have stayed at some budget RedRoof type hotels, but this is certainly THE WORST HOTEL I HAVE EVER VISITED! I wouldn't reccomend this even if all other hotels are booked, stay in Queens or the Bronx before staying here.",negative,en

ゴジラ検定公式テキストと題されているだけあって、分かりやすい書かれ方をしていると思います。 特に登場人物相関図はなかなかに参考になり、「ゴジラ大辞典」なんかと併せて読むと理解が増すかと。登場人物一覧は掲載人数が多く写真付きなのが嬉しい所。ただ相関図は写真がついていないのが惜しいかと。 1つの映画に対してカラー刷りが2ページ＋登場人物相関図、登場兵器、登場怪獣、時々コラムや検定問題が挟まっている、という構成です。 分かりやすく纏まっていて、これからゴジラの事を勉強したい人には良い一冊かと思います。 ただ、今まで出版された本以上の目新しさは殆どありません。 ゴジラ大辞典やオール東宝シリーズの方が遥かに情報は充実しておりマニアックで、スチールも貴重なものが多いです。 ポスターやグッズと言ったサブ要素も殆ど載っておらず、一つ一つの情報は簡素化されています。 またゴジラ検定なので当然ではありますが、変身人間シリーズと言ったゴジラ以外の特撮作品はコラム数ページで写真もありません。 悪いわけではないですが十分ゴジラを親しまれて来た方には今更感のある内容かと思います。 あと個人的にはシンゴジラに関する比重が多いので好き嫌いが分かれる要素になるかと。,neutral,ja

The rest of my stay was basically uneventful..... until I got home and reviewed my credit card activity. I realized that I was charged about 50 dollars more than what my bill said. I called the hotel right away to clarify. I was told that every guest gets charged 50 dollars per day just in case they order movies, phone calls etc. Then the money is returned to the customer within next 5 bussiness days. This is their policy. I was shocked because I have never heard about this and I stay at different Marriotts all the time. I was never informed about this poicy in the first place and I should have.

"We just returned from a weekend in San Francisco at the Ritz Carlton. This was our first time in the city and we loved it. The Ritz was also a good choice. The hotel location is great - central to Chinatown, Union Square and cable car line/stops to the Ferry port and Fisherman's Wharf. We stayed on the club floor. As usual, the service was fabulous. They helped us with restaurants and car service, and recommended we go to the ferry port on Saturday where there was a unbelievable farmers market. Breakfast, cocktails and the cookies were excellent; the early evening offerings were just okay. Our room #831 was very large and beautifully decorated, but the location wasn't good - we were right off the club floor kitchen and had virtually no view (view blocked by the front facade and roof line). I got the feeling that maybe this room isn't used often because it was missing the clock radio and the water coming from the sink faucet was initially brown. Overall, the service, as you'd expect, was excellent, the Club very good and our room was average for a Ritz property.",positive,en

"Not as bad as some are making it out to be, though obviously pathetic compared to the original. In my opinion Amitabh was great as the villain Babban Singh - try not to compare to Gabbar in the original as they were clearly not going for the same effect. Other than some mediocre action scenes however, the rest of the film is flawed. Character development was poor and the development of the story was hopeless, with many loopholes, and missing pieces of information which i wouldn't have known if i hadn't read the back of the DVD case. The worst part of the movie was the support roles from Nisha Kothari and especially this new dude called Prashant Raj. Nisha is just plain annoying from the time her lips first open. As for Prashant Raj - seriously who is this guy? where is he from and why on earth was he present in the film studio for anything other than to serve drinks?. His acting ability is zero and he has the same tone, dialog delivery and staunch expression in every scene, whether it be action, comedy, or even a scene when someone has just died. Ajay Devgan was average, at least his expressions changed which is more than i can say for his mistake of a companion. overall, RGV's Aag is worth watching for Amitabh's solid performance, and also a very sexy Urmilla Matondkar in a special appearance.",negative,en

There are monumental backlit white boxes with botanical themes printed on them above each bed providing a focal point for the room and interesting lighting for romantic moments.
I stayed in three different rooms and found them all quiet. The thermostat worked well.
The 'rain' head in the shower is another feature although it was so high tech we couldn't get it to work at will. The shower is huge - definitely enough room for two. The bathroom is stocked with organic toiletries by Bigelow. I spent my entire stay there smelling like lavender and peppermint.
We had fun in the bar on the second floor - there's all kinds of random modernist furniture to roll around on as you get drunk on overpriced drinks.
I had the room service breakfast -$48US for two greasy pork sausages, oily eggs, hash browns, oj and coffee. I ate about 1/3 of it. Also they didn't seem to want to take my room service order because I prepaid my stay.
I had a lot of troubles with service at the hotel. I think I got poorer service because I prepaid and got a discount through an internet booking site. The room I got was massive and cost about 1/3 of what it should have so I think the staff thought I had gotten my value for money already. For example my television didn't work and it took ten phone calls to get some action on that. I was sick and just wanted to lie in bed and watch TV. That doesn't seem like such an incredible request but the front of house people rolled their eyes, looked at each other and failed to act time after time.
The Thomson is a cool hotel in a fantastic location (public transport is across the road, you can walk to the East Village, Chinatown, Brooklyn). Having said that it feels like you are staying in money making machine. The staff are a bit cold but just give it back to them - they work in a hotel after all, not in the fashion industry",negative,en

I love that we have a great comedy club in Pittsburgh with a great location at the Waterfront. Perfect for a date night and I recommend going to a later show and grabbing dinner beforehand. I received an online coupon code for $5 tickets for John Heffron. What a deal-def. check for deals before you pay full price for any shows here. We went early to pick up the tickets at the ticket office. People were lined up outside about an hour before the show and it was freezing out. I had no interest in doing this so we grabbed a beer across the street at Rock Bottom. Once they opened the doors (15 minutes before show time) the line went quickly and even though we were at the end we still got seated at a table in the back. It is not huge inside so there aren't really any bad seats. They usually have an MC for the night who starts warming up the crowd. This guy was funny and so was the opening act before John Heffron. My only complaint about this place is that they have a two drink minimum and the prices are outrageous. $9.50 for a mixed well drink and $7 for draft beers. The soda was $3.50! Yikes! At least we didn't pay full price for the tickets.,negative,en

When I complained the steak they took back and returned totally overdone6.

"The Carlton is a classic old school hotel - grand lobby, beautiful furnishing and TINY rooms. The photos posted on the web of the ""standard room"" which showed an armchair, bed and desk were nothing like the room we had, which had a bed, a small desk and desk chair and about 1 square foot of space. No where to put a suitcase (it did have drawers and a small closet, but this meant unpacking for our short stay). Nowhere other than the bed to sit. I know that New York hotel rooms are small . The bathroom was beautiful and had a bath and a shower, but again, did not even have a shelf or any other space to put your toothbrush & toiletries. We also had an extremely loud heater/air con that kept me awake much of the night.
The area appears very safe. To me, having stayed downtown in the past, it was dull and lacked places to eat nearby. That said, the concierge was very helpful at making reservations or suggeting places to eat. It is close to the some of the shopping areas and the empire state. It's about as far away from a subway station as you can get in Manhatten (which is still not that far)",negative,en

"The lobby, bar, and restaurants were renovated and very pleasant. The room, however, while large, appeared in need of updating. The air conditioning was a problem. It turned off while sleeping because it's activated by motion sensors. As I didn't toss and turn enough, the a/c wouldn't stay on. In addition, if you are expecting hot water, you need to be patient. I stayed in the south tower and it seemed to take a full 3 minutes before the water reached an acceptable temperature. Sheraton brand toiletries were provided including shaving cream and razors. Unlike most Starwood properties, there was no evidence of a heavenly bed. It just wasn't as comfortable as I've come to expect. Some of my co-workers complained about the quality/coarseness of the linens. The property offered excellent conference facilities, an extremely large and outstanding gym, and helpful concierge staff.

"I stayed for 3 nights (9-12 November) and found that the quality of both the room and the service is over-rated, as compared to cheaper rates in other hotels. I paid $216 a night + tax for a room with a double bed, and my friend was staying in a similar room close to Union square for half that price. Next time, I'll stay at that hotel.
1) Staff is typically unfriendly, as other guests have noted on this forum. I am starting to believe that they are paid to be rough and unhelpful to customers.
2) More importantly, there may be a serious problem with honesty in this hotel.
2.1) I had book parcels sent to me, and I never got one of them, officially ""never received"", but the sender has shown me the USPS slip.
2.2) on the day I was leaving, I went down to eat breakfast at 8 am, by the time I was back up in the room, the maid had done the room and .. my face cream (an expensive fancy one from a famous luxurious French brand), was missing from my beauty case. Hmm, i'll give it a doubt, one never knows, but I am 80% convinced the maid stole the cream. I asked the front desk immediately, but they said the maid was ... out (?!) and I had to call back the next day. And of course the next day... the maid, called Marisa, or Marianna, I don't remember clearly, said she never found anything
2.3) it just so happens that as I went downstairs for the check out, another lady guest reported that her purse, with all credit cards etc. had gone missing from her room after the maid had come in.
THAT WAS A BIT MUCH !!!!!
I don't know the end to that story, but i suspect there is a problem with honesty in this hotel.

"I read this because someone recommended it to me, and it was a cute read. Other reviewers have already summed up the book, so I won't go into that. I'd say the author's biggest strength is her humor. I'll give an example. The hero had the heroine in a bath (she wasn't feeling well at the time so he was trying to bring down her fever), and she asked, ""What am I doing here and why do I keep touching your lovely chest?"" It was the last part that had me laughing out loud. Even as I think of it now, I'm laughing.This is a good book for people who like women disguised as men stories where the women are strong and fully capable of taking care of themselves. The heroine was no wimpering female, and the hero was lovable too.One thing I don't understand is why this was tagged as a Christian romance. If you're familiar with the traditional market for Christian romances, this is not tame enough to be termed Christian. There's stuff in here that would be deemed offensive. Though the hero and heroine never went all the way, they did go pretty far, and since Christian romances don't go beyond the kiss and some readers thinking necking is ""lustful"", I don't know if I'd recommend this book to women who are uncomfortable with nudity and touching body parts that are usually covered. (For me, this is not a problem, but since I've seen some reviews by women who expected a very clean Christian romance and got upset with ""necking"", they won't like this book. But if you like a little more realism in your book, then I say go for it!)Like I said, I have no problems with this book. It was fun and light and perfect for a nice beach read.",positive,en
"When I say DISAP you say POINTED. Disappointed! Disappointed! I really hate writing this review because in the past we have had such great experiences at EDO and this review is not about the food because the Sushi and Hibachi are good food. But the service...WHOA!\n\nPicture it...Valentines Day and my wife and almost 2 year old want a nice dinner. We debated many nice places but with the child they can be difficult at times so we decided some Sushi and Hibachi is nice, quick and delicious. So we plan a early arrival at a place we have been to before...EDO! When we arrive the place is almost empty and we get one of the private dining rooms.\n\nSushi Rolls are ordered as an appetizer. Dumplings and chicken fried rice are ordered are ordered for our daughter to come out with the appetizers. And a Hibachi meal to split for my wife and I as an entree. And....we wait.\n\nAfter 50 minutes still no food. Ok, starting to get annoyed. 1 hour and 15 minutes of waiting and here come our sush....nope. it is our Hibachi entree. WTF? Really? I was explained by the waitress that they had an influx of orders and were really behind. Hmmmm, ok...so I decided to scope out the scene because they obviously had many patrons arrive after we did. Not so much, because the place had maybe 2 people at the Hibachi table, 2 people at the sushi bar, and about 5 other tables full. In other words the place was dead.\n\nAbout 10 minutes after our entree arrived our daughters food arrived and the chicken friend rice was bland and the dumplings were still cold. \n\n1.5 hours after our arrive we finally got 2 of our 3 sushi rolls and the third about 10 minutes after that. We enjoyed the first 2 rolls and got the third to go as we were obviously over the experience and not even our daughter who was starving liked her food (she ate what she probably really wanted after we left, McDonalds).\n\nI have a hard time understanding a couple things here. 1) How does it take 1.5 hours for sushi when the place is dead. 2) Why would you bring our entree our before our appetizer when we clearly wanted the sushi first? 3) When we placed the kids order and said bring that ASAP....does that mean an hour of so later? \n\nDo not get me wrong. Besides the chicken fried rice and the frozen dumplings the hibachi and sushi were great but holy lord the service was about as fun as watching Alabama win a National Football Championship (and for an Auburn fan that is not fun).\n\nSorry EDO, I love your food and maybe you can make it up to me in the future but the service last night was pure crap and a major turn off. What happened EDO? What happened? DISAP...\n\nOh yeah, oh, the steamed rice and little sauces that normally accompany the hibachi never arrived and when we asked the waitress she knew nothing about them.",negative,en

"My husband and I stayed here for a convention/awards ceremony put on by his company. The company paid for everything, so I can't complain about money or value, but this place was disgusting. Even the cheapest places should be clean, let alone a 4-star ocean front hotel. We were in one of the last groups to arrive from the airport (11pm), and no king rooms were available, so we were given two double beds. We were tired, so the first thing I did was turn down my bed. I was horrified to find 4 or 5 long black head-hairs up at the top of the bed, and 2 more ""insidious"" small hairs in the middle of the bed. Needless to say, neither of us would sleep in that bed, as it obviously had not had the sheets changed, so for two nights we both slept in one somewhat cramped double bed. The bathroom also had many hairs along the floor and in the tub. Though the hotel was new and had a very pretty design, I can't give it more than two stars for neglecting to perform very basic essential hygiene practices.",negative,en

"This new Fukuburger is a joke. It's all hype like this whole FAME place. I have been at this location twice, and they messed up on my orders twice. 9 bucks for one burger? That doesn't even include fries. Now I used to love Fukuburger. I've had them since I was a junior in high school, and I always got the Tamago and it was by far one of the best I've ever had. But after having the new FAME location's Tamago, twice, I am no longer a fan. Both times, the fried onions were so stale, and that's basically the best damn part. Now the first time, they forgot to make my jazz fries. The second time, we ordered three burgers, we got two, everything got lost in translation and she had to buy another burger. The kitchen staff is so unorganized. It's ridiculous. I guess there's room for improvement, but it's really sad to see a great burger joint downgrade. This was such a great opportunity for them, and congrats for an actual location, but I'm giving them two stars because the kitchen quality is shit and the price they give us is not worth it.",negative,en

"Okay, the name is bad (what were they THINKING?) but the fact is... this gelato is SOOOO Good. \nWhen my brother visits from out of town, he drives out of his way to go to this place for dessert EVERY DAY. If we're out at a restaurant anywhere near this place, he always chooses to skip dessert at the restaurant just so we can have Angel Sweet instead. He's a chocolate freak too and he and I agree that the chocolate offerings at Angel Sweet are second to none. Unlike Gelato Spot, who doesn't always have a pure chocolate offering (usually they have hazelnut or almond in them), Angel Sweet usually has two pure chocolates that can be mixed with something else of your choice. \nI love the fact that I can get two flavors of my choice even in the small size. Yay!\nSo if you're craving chocolate-covered strawberries, go for the Super Dark Chocolate with strawberry, raspberry or any other similar fruity flavor--the pairing is wonderful!\nAlso, if they have the Chocolate Cake Batter, that's a winner with Coconut.\n\nAnd while I won't say that it's THE BEST gelato I've ever had--that goes to Glace Faite Maison in Ille.

Wenn man wie ich auf ein gebügeltes Hemd angewiesen ist, benötigt man im Zuge einer Reise eine Bügelausrüstung, welche man im Zimmer des Chandler Inn vergebens suchen wird.
Wer also plätten mag, muss sich am Forntdesk ausrüste lassen. Nicht unbedingt toll, aber man überlebt es.
Right around the corner findet man einen wunderbaren kleinen Coffeeshop, der dank ganz eigenem Charme einlädt, dort den Tag zu starten. Auch wenn man zwei, drei Meter gehen muss, um nach Downtown zu gelangen, eignet sich das Chandler ohne Frage für die Erkundung dieser wundervollen Stadt.

マウスが角飛びするようになったので、評価も良いこのマウスを購入。 充電し電源をONにするも赤色LEDライトが一瞬点滅し、消灯。 返品も考えたが、とりあえず販売元にメール。 すぐに対応してくれてメールの3日後辺りには同じ新しいマウスが到着。 今回は、LEDライトも点灯し続けて、問題なく使用することが出来ました。 ただ、最初のマウスはこちらで処分とのこと。金属も使われているし、処分しにくい... 交換による不良の原因を探ってもらいたかったですが。送料もかかりますしね。 使用して思った事は、マウス自体が長い！ スクロールホイールに人差し指が届くのはわずがです。 スクロールホイールに合わせると、戻る。送るボタンが結構、親指の移動が必要。 静かではあるし、軽いですけど。。。",negative,ja

"Provigo is your standard grocery store--nothing too exciting here folks but it has all the basics you need. Its close for us McGill students and get really busy on Monday night when there is 10% of your purchase over $50 with a student ID. The President's Choice branded products are good, I have yet to be disappointed from frozen foods (chicken wings and fingers are particularly good) to pasta sauce and ice cream. The prices here are high compared to its suburban counterparts but I find their prices to be lower than nearby Metro. The service is bad. The unionized staff care little for the cleanliness of the store itself and the cashiers are generally unfriendly and unhelpful. They often have good prices for beer and wine, so stock up when they're on sale. If you are buying a lot of goods, and you don't have a car, they over delivery for $1. The delivery takes a few hours at least, so if you're cupboards are bare you might want to carry home. The reason I shop here is because its the closets thing to a 'superstore' that we have in downtown MTL. They have a full pharmacy--with helpful pharmacists. So its definitely a one-stop shop: drugs, fresh food, alcohol (beer and wine only), and an extensive selection of frozen foods. So come here if you must, its well located for McGill students and cheaper than Metro.",negative,en

When we got up there, the room was fabulous. bathroom was nice and large and our view of the strip was the pit across where venetian was expanding their shopping area. Not too bad... the cool thing was that we watched the sirens show from up there and go to see the pseudo fireworks fly towards us. that was neat. otherwise the beds were comfortable, everything was great. the pool was on the small side but we got to lay out and tan. didn't do much in ti though, it was seriosly a shit shower and shave place for us. it was conveniently located within walking distance to wynn and fashion show!",neutral,en

"Stayed here for a couple of nights in November and I 100% will not be returning.
The rooms are shabby: kitchen cupboard doors broken, holes in walls badly patched up, just tired looking.
We had a 'suite' so had a sofa bed. This was okay, I managed to sleep on it. But NO duvet or quilt was provided and only 1 really manky pillow. I rang reception asking for a duvet and they said they couldn't provide one for the sofa bed. Instead they brought this gross green blanket which looked like cut up curtains. There were cigarette holes and stains on it!!! Not pleasant.
Breakfast was a joke. Cheap cereals and unappetising cakes. Certainly not the 'continental breakfast' I read about in the reviews.
Lastly, the hotel STANK when we were there. Smelt like moth balls. I since read another review which said the hotel had been fumigated. The hotel staff looked at me like I was mad when I asked what the smell was!
The only redeeming feature of the hotel is its proximity to central park.

"Stayed here in March for a weekend, based on a Priceline rate of about 65 dollars a night. Couldn't complain with that rate. Large room, typically well-equipped. The hotel is near a fire station, but that didn't bother me. Seemed to have lots of tour groups, including school groups, which could mean more noise. Most significant thing about my stay was that the hotel missed delivering me a message. When the mistake was brought to their attention later that evening, the front office manager came up and apologized in person, and then sent me a wine and cheese platter. A nice touch to ensure that my lasting impression was a positive one. The location is OK, a long walk to Georgetown and Dupont Circle, but lots of restaurants in the M and K Street areas nearby, many of which have half-off Sunday and Monday specials.",negative,en

"This is the second addition to Frank Baum's personally produced trilogy of Oz films. It's essentially the same childishness as in the other two pictures, although I consider it preferable to the others because it's shorter. As in the other films, there are performers in animal costumes, an adult woman pretends to be a boy, and the characters and plot jump all over the place while the camera-work is static. This time, at the centre is a magic cloak that grants wishes, and the boy played by a woman is made a king.Most of the special effects are witnessed at the beginning. Fairies are represented by multiple-exposure photography. And, there's a man in the moon that looks just like those made by Georges Méliès years before, most famously in 'Le Voyage dans la lune' (1902). Méliès' imaginative fantasies and creative trick effects made him the leading pioneer of early cinema, and the films he made around the turn of the century were far better and even technically more advanced than this trifling Oz series.",negative,en

The corn beef was delicious thinly sliced and just the right amount on the sandwich. They use red cabbage, Russian dressing and Gruyere cheese. It also came with a small sample of strawberry apple salad which was delicious as well.. I really enjoyed the sandwich it was fresh and filled me up without making me feel heavy. My other got a blanco pide which is a much heavier dish because of all the cheese but he said the ingredients were fresh and the flavor combinations were really good. The pides are large and he could not finish it and brought it to the hotel and finished it later. We also ordered a morning wake up smoothie and it Was truly amazing!!! The drinks are a little pricey but all and all I feel for Vegas the food was fairly priced... $4.50 for coconut water? Holy moly! \n\nThe service was great fast and prompt.

I just don't get it, it doesn't set the tone for me to hand over my cash. \n\nWith the above said, I expect the meal I got. It was cheap, basic and nothing I'd come back for. \n\nMy girlfriend had an omelet - the worst I've ever seen. Eggs were overcooked, toppings were scarce and you're supposed to fold in the ingredients, but it looks like they cooked the eggs, forgot about the toppings, and then stuffed them in the egg as if it were a shell to a taco. \n\nMy dad had pancakes and toast - or rather they brought him out French Toast in error (I mean, he ask for toast, the waiter asked what kind, and he said Wheat. How he brought out French Toast instead...) Again, my dad said it was nothing special.\n\nI had over-easy eggs, hash browns and something else. I substituted the toast for sausage, but they brought me out toast anyway. I switched with my dad and ate his French Toast. Eggs were as to be expected, not much you can mess up there. Hash browns were minimal and too crispy. The sausage was a patty similar to what you'd get at McDonalds. \n\nOverall, we had 3 different breakfast items, all three weren't what you'd expect to pay for, the coffee was probably something cheap as usual, and overall the awkwardness of the place just didn't do anything for me.\n\n\nThe one thing I did not like at all and would have to complain about though was the little girl helper. Cute, but c'mon, I don't want a kid who just stuck her hand in her mouth to then hand me my plate of food. I'm not a germ-a-fob, but c'mon!!!! The place wasn't terrible, but I'd rather drive a few miles down the road and eat at a good breakfast joint.",negative,en

"Needed a place for husband I for 1 night to attend a party. This hotel was very near where the party was held and was less expensive than most other hotels we looked it. Room was very small, but totally adequate for 2 people for one night. Bed was very comfortable and room seemed clean. Free wi-fi, and lighted makeup mirror on desk is a nice touch. The entire hotel is smoke-free, and definitely did not have any smoky smell. The elevator smelled really good, because of the coffee lounge on the ground floor. The hotel is secure (they buzz you in) and there was a small safe in the room. Lounge on ground floor is a nice touch with a great coffee machine that makes cappucinos, lattes, etc -- free for guests.
The negatives -- 1) hot water was very tempermental. Start running it early to make sure it is warm enough for your shower. Even during shower, water temp kept changing on its own. 2) our room was adjacent to the elevator, which was fine most of the time. But in the early morning hours it was making a terrible racket for about 30 min. 3) even though outside temps were in the 50s and 60s, the room was way too warm, even after turning the radiator off. We had to run the a/c, but that was fine.

"We chose this hotel based on its location and its reported 3 star rating. We expected the rooms to be a bit on the small side but they were incredibly small. We have been on cruises where our cabin was larger. This hotel is way beyond need of a major makeover. It is also very dark in the rooms....even though the sun was blaring brightly when we went out of the hotel.
The carpets in the room were quite disgustingly tattered and frayed. Our towels were too worn and beyond what we donate to animal shelters. The hair dryer is located over by the tub on the wall opposite the sink and vanity shelf area. Quite challenging to dry my hair without getting electrocuted from the water that was on the floor because the shower wall is not adequate to keep the water in if you decide to shower. The paint on the walls....well, that was quite something. The pictures online were of white and yellow walls. Our dark room had the walls painted a red-orange and green. The paint job was slopped up-not well done at all. Their attempt at hip and trendy really missed the mark and presented more of a depressing, run down dive effect. The space was so small that I had to keep the suitcases on top of one another and live out of them for our entire stay. The clost only had 6 hangers in it and there was not room for much more than that. The tv was also very limited - we could only get a few channels. Our cell phones did not work in our rooms either which made for some inconvenience. Oh, and the bed....very cheap, uncomfortable mattress. Woke up feeling those mattress coils in our hips!
The staff was very friendly. If the rooms were gutted and redone, they would be worth considering, even though they are tiny. We are from NY City and now stay at hotels when we return to visit friends. If we are paying upwards of $300/night or anywhere in that range, we expect a better experience than this.",negative,en

"From the minute I made reservations to the time I left, the hotel was nothing but accomodating! The room was large and had a view of the water and the bathroom was huge! Lots of room for two people!
The Inn is in the middle of the Public Market place and so you are close to restaurants, clubs and shopping. Also close to the new library and other attractions. The staff was very friendly and very, very helpful in setting up tours for me and all of their suggestions were great. Cannot say enough about this hotel! From the outside to the room to the hallways, it was very clean and at night very quiet. The deck area was a nice plus - a great place to sit and watch the boats in the Sound and have a glass of wine.
Only downside is that they do not have a shuttle service from the airport or train station - that would have made it perfect. One thing to note - if you are travelling with someone elderly or has some disability that calls for a wheel chair or walker, the hotel is on a hill which means if you go to the Market,you will have to climb a steep grade back to the hotel.

This guy was a real piece of work, he couldn't decide how long it was going to take him and gave me estimates varying from 15 to 60 minutes and suggested I leave and come back, but failed to return my ID until I pointed out that I wasn't going to leave without it. He called my about 15 minutes later and said he was done and suggested I return to the store sooner rather than later as if it's some sort of emergency. When I got back I decided to accept their offer and Einstein here gave me $3 instead of $23 and then had to call his manager to get the register open again. He apologized and said it had been a long day. I pointed out that it was only noon and he responded that he'd been up since 6.

"We stayed here for two nights during a recent trip to San Fran because we wanted to stay in an economical motel near to Ocean Beach so that we could go surfing and access the city by tram.
Positives
-Tram really convenient. Stops outside the motel front door and gets you downtown in 30minutes.
- Ocean beach area is pleasant with Surfside cafe, interesting residential houses to check out, beach very near by.
- Owner of the motel was helpful and polite at all times. He was willing to get out of bed to sort out a problem we had with our room. Owner offered to move us to room that was not directly above the pub which is situated under a part of this motel. We were not disturbed by any noise.
-Furniture in room could be considered retro. It is not entirely without charm (pink tiled bath suite and wooden sideboard have retro appeal). Unfortunately this furniture is not cared for, polished or made into a feature.
-Good amount of parking spaces.
-Seemed a relatively safe area to stay. Interesting contrast to downtown.
- Hot water and shower fine. Bathroom was acceptable in terms of cleanliness (contrast to dusty and shabby bedroom).
Negatives
- Bed bugs. We have stayed in lots of economy accommodation worldwide but have never been bitten by bed bugs so much before. My partner was bitten all over his face and we both received tell-tale lines of bites on our arms. The added problem of this was that we have now had to scrupulously launder all our clothes and suitcases back home, fearful the bed bugs might have hitched a ride with us. The bed was very old and rickety.
- The 'heater' smelled of gas and consisted of an orange gas flame behind a grill. We asked for this to be switched off fearful of carbon monoxide poisoning.
- The toilet blocked one morning and because we had been asking the owner for help to switch off the gas heater at 12pm the night before we decided to wait until we returned from our daytrip to ask for assistance with the toilet. Hotel staff discovered the blocked toilet over the course of the day and fixed it for us without us needing to request assistance but at the same time took away all our towels and did not replace. Since we were leaving the next morning and had been back and forth to the office for help we decided to use our beach towels the last evening.
- Very dark room with no natural light.
- Carpet very old, worn and dirty (could harbour more bed bugs). Floorboards underneath unsteady and rickety.
This place could be worth the $90 a night we paid if the bed and carpet is replaced and bed bugs eradictated. A deep clean of the room we stayed in was also well over due. Be totally clear in your mind what you are paying for if you choose to stay here, for us the hassle of making sure we don't transport any bed bugs to our home. I don't know anything about fires but the gas heater looked lethal to me, opt for it to be switched off to be safe. The owner does not try and pretend that he is offering anything more than he has in his motel, he let us look at the room first but I would never stay here again after our last two days. I hope that the pleasant owner spends some money upgrading this place because it could be a great motel!",negative,en

"As a Las Vegas local I had been eager to try this new and highly raved about buffet. I met an out-of-town friend for lunch at the buffet yesterday. We met at 12:15 and only waited about 15 minutes in line. Once inside, we didn't have to wait longer than 3 people for anything, so we were very surprised how convenient the lunchtime buffet was. Other reviews indicate that dinner is a different story - so I recommend going for lunch! No, you won't get crab legs at lunch, but if that isn't important to you, then go for lunch! I don't think anyone can eat everything here, so I will only speak to the things we ate. The lunch buffet with tax was $32. Honestly, most people will probably spend $20 to $30 on lunch anywhere on the Strip, so it's not an entirely bad deal. The service was excellent and our drinks never went below half empty. Here's my food comments. Things I loved: the sushi was surprisingly good though the soy sauce had too much sodium. The cooked meats were killer good - including the brisket and ribs, cut to order. Excellent sweet cornbread. The shrimp on ice and seafood paella was good. The mac-n-cheese was not your standard mac-n-cheese and really awesome! The tacos are made to order - you just tell them the meat and he grills it up and makes it for you. NOW FOR THE DESSERT. SAVE ROOM FOR DESSERT! The bread pudding was excellent - espcially with a hot cup of coffee after lunch! \n\nIt says there is a 2-hour maximum. We stayed longer and nobody said anything. But it also wasn't very busy and we were just chatting mostly - and not consuming ravenous amounts of food. As we were leaving at 3:15pm, we noticed that the crab legs were being served. Again, not my thing - but if they come out for \""dinner\"" at 3:00pm, you might be wise to eat around 3-4pm to avoid long lines. \n\nI will definitely return for the lunch buffet. Probably not for the dinner buffet - because I can't eat $50 worth of food. It's a very good buffet experience that you should try at least once!",neutral,en
"Mike Nichols' film ""Charlie Wilson's War"", set in the 1980's, tells the story of how the title character (played by Tom Hanks) managed to wage a covert war with the Russkies by way of aiding the Afghan forces. Of course, we know how well that turned out in the long run but, thankfully, the film does not gloss over the unpleasant after-effects.The cast is star-studded, with Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts being among the most bankable stars in Hollywood. As a bonus, you've got the versatile Philip Seymour Hoffman in a characteristically memorable supporting role, one for which he received a not unwarranted Oscar nomination. I'm not much of a fan of Roberts but Hanks is always dependable. Nevertheless, I can't quite buy into him as a drug-using womanizer, although the real Charlie Wilson seems just as eminently likable as Hanks. Apart from the big three, though, there's not much worth remarking on, even from a recognizable name like Amy Adams.The story is engaging and is bolstered by a fine script from Aaron Sorkin. The verbal interplay between the main characters is excellent and is chock full of memorable lines. The later events set into motion by the war are not ignored though the bookending scenes honoring Wilson seem to me to be too earnest to achieve the bittersweet feel which was likely intended. On the whole, Nichols' direction is workmanlike and follows the action of the script admirably.This is a film that, like Charlie Wilson himself, has flaws but is nevertheless disarmingly likable. Certainly recommended for fans of the three stars and for those looking for an engaging political drama with a light-hearted feel.",positive,en
"The spoof genre, which has lacked creativity and humor for some time already, gets spat upon yet again by hacks with no talent. No point, no fun, no originality; just a few cheap bucks for the film makers. It takes more than just referencing some recent movies and giving characters double-meaning names to be satire; to make people laugh. Any clod can pick up a cam-corder, and have some bad-acting buddies in cheap costumes imitate somebody. Since the genre being targeted this time is inspirational sports movies, there are a few lame references thrown out to movies of that type: the jokes are so weak the characters actually have to emphasize the references in various ways, to get you to laugh hysterically. It doesn't work.That's not comedy. However, the same old worn out sophomoric ""jokes"" ripped off from a middle school washroom (done even more blandly than usual) are all here. If that's not enough, there's a running ""gag"" of a bus running somebody over. So funny, right? Also, one pathetically poor scene does more product placement than Michael Bay; again with the same unfunny results. A musical bit flops miserably. Pity Carl Weathers, once Apollo Creed in the Rocky series, now stuck with roles in swill like this.Lousy beyond words. Watching a snail run the marathon would be less tedious than watching this film is. Probably a lot funnier, too.",negative,en

It's a cement park with a big bowl and a snake run with spines, quarters and cool banks. If you don't like crowds though go during the day while the kids are at school. The dog park is also pretty good. The people are generally friendly, except for one lady who doesn't let any dog even sniff her dog. It is equipped with watering stations and bags.",neutral,en
［使用感］ 個人的な好みに分かれますが、自分はこのキーボードの打鍵音が好みで音も小さく何よりキーが軽かったので気に入りました。 ［デザイン］ 小さく、コンパクトでカバンに入れやすく、デザインもシンプルで邪魔にならない配色をしているのでオススメです。 ［利便性］ 特徴とも言えるコンパクトなサイズですが、使っていて物足りなさを感じることもなく、それより持ち運びしやすいという利点の方が大きかったです。 ［耐久面］ まだ使って1週間ちょっとしか経っていないですが、もちろん今のところ不具合などもないです。,positive,ja

"Wilmington to Fort Myers, a route I have flown from different departure airports (BWI and PHL) and airlines many times. The checkin at Wilmington DE was uneventful, I have precheck and always have a personal carryon with an ipad and was instructed to remove it by TSA - a first in all my travels. The waiting room was very crowded and no one was wearing a mask and this the first flight I decided not to wear one. The boarding process was organized and the only issue I had was, my original reservation was for seat 3C but my ticket/boarding pass was for 6C or a seat $3.00 less in value. The flight attendants were quite green and stumbled as they read the canned announcements but were quite pleasant. The flight was on time and disembarking was normal. My one negative was coming down with Covid 3 days later and giving to my wife. I have always worn an N95 when flying commercially and this is the first time I did not and severely regretted it.",positive,en

"We decided to check out Blue during the Dine Out Charlotte weekend since the menu looked pretty darn appetizing. We dressed for a night out on the town, and despite her dress and my shirt and snazzy dress jeans we still felt slightly under-dressed. Blue has the looks of a fancy smancy place and dishes out food that exceeds expectations.\n\nWe arrived on a Saturday evening at 6 and were blown away the second we walked in the door. The place simply screams \""swanky\"" with a sharp, classy interior and interesting dining room layout. The host and servers were extremely formal and proper, which only made us feel like we were somewhere we didn't belong. But enough about the ambiance...on to the food!\n\nAfter taking our drink orders (the wine list is like gigantic!) the waitress brought over some complimentary bread and butter. The bread consisted of a cheese focaccia which was warm and cheesy, and there was also a dark cranberry walnut that was equally tasty. The bread is served with a dish of kalamata olive butter which I'm always a fan of. I can't explain it...I hate olives but I love it when they are infused in butter!\n\nFor an appetizer I ordered the caesar salad with pork belly croutons. The salad is served a la wedge and lightly drizzled with a caesar dressing. Alongside the lettuce was some roasted tomatoes (not a fan of tomaters, but the missus loved them) and carmelized red onion, which went good with the lettuce. But the real kicker was the pork belly croutons. Don't let the name fool you...these are not dried, hard chunks of pork. There was at least six decent sized balls of pork belly on top of the plate. Each one was deep fried to perfection, giving it a hot, crunchy outside yet retaining the juicy, succulent pork belly inside. It was like eating a deep fried ball of the white fatty part of bacon...it was just that damn good. This pork belly is not for everyone, but if you're proud to be a bacon fat kind of person, this little tasting of heaven is something you can't miss.\n\nThe missus ordered the calamari as her appetizer. The calamari was kind of \""meh\"", and the batter was way too heavy and just wasn't good. The plate also comes with some fried olives and hot peppers which she devoured in a heart beat. I wouldn't recommend the calamari since I've had better quality stuff at lesser restaurants.\n\nFor dinner I ordered the bison osso buco, and it was nothing short of tastetacular. Six huge hunks of slow-cooked bison meat sat upon a bed of roasted root veggies. The bison was awesome, and I love getting it when it's on a menu. It was also refreshing to see bison as an actual dish and not just a burger. The meat was lean yet still moist from whatever magic the cook worked on it. The bison juices all mingled with the root veggies which consisted of carrots, potatoes and some others. Oh, and I almost forgot the spetzel! There's spetzel mixed in with the veggies and it was crispy yet chewy, and simply perfect. This was one heck of a dish and a great alternative for the steak lover who wants to try something new.\n\nThe missus got the pan seared scallops, and these things were massive! The sea scallops were cooked to perfection and served with a great seasoning and sauce. The dish came with broccolini and other veggies that were SMOKED (awesome!) and a potatoe puree that was pretty darn good. \n\nNow the portions here are huge...you're getting a full meal, not a small fancy tasting. We both ate half our entrees and took the leftovers home for dinner the following night (still tasted awesome reheated!) We weren't fully stuffed yet, but we had to save room for dessert. I ordered the sticky toffee pudding, and if you have a sweet tooth this is the dessert for you. The toffee \""pudding\"" is actually baked so it's more cake-like, and its served upon a sea of melty caramel sauce. There are some hard toffee chips sprinkled about to give some texture, and on top of the pudding is a heaping scoop of dulche de leche gelato that was awesome. The toffee, caramel and dulche flavors were all great on their own, but when combined into one mighty spoonful I achieved dessert nirvana. This is one of the best desserts I've had in the area, and there is no way I would go back here and not order it.\n\nThe missus had the baklava for dessert and gobbled it all up. There was pistachio and pear stuffed inside this huge Greek pastry, and it was served with a side of marscapone cheese. Bakalava isn't normally my thing but I won't deny the tastiness of this dessert, though it was definitely second to the sheer power of the toffee pudding.\n\nBlue is a swanky place, and you will pay for the ambiance through your food, which isn't exactly on the cheap side. We would not want to pay full price for a meal here (simply because it's a bit out of our price range) but it would make for a tempting Restaurant Week visit.",neutral,en
"My boyfriend and I came here with his dad for breakfast before what turned out to be 3 hours of craps.\n\nI ordered an eggwhite omelette with chunks of asparagus in them. Benefits were that it gave me great energy to withstand those 3 hours of dice throwing, cons were that the taste was just meh. It wasn't anything special and I've had better omel....well I don't think you can really call an omelette better because after all it's an egg and how badly can a restaurant mess up cooking an egg. What you can mess up is on the combinations and i've had better omelette combinations at the Mandalay Bay cafe. I mean all this omelette had was asparagus which already explains why it has no flavor. \n\nIt wasn't anything special or bad, but it wouldn't deter me from coming back here either. I would probably order something else next time or if I feel like being healthy and energized, order this again.",negative,en

"What sells for this hotel is its close proximity to the oft-photographed/filmed Times Square. It is literally right there when you step out from the hotel. Located just off Broadway at 47th Street, it has a Starbucks just across the street, TKTS discount ticket booth a few more paces away, walking distance to the multitude of restaurants in Hell's Kitchen and, of course, the theatres for Boradway musicals.
The rooms do not stand out for me. Room size is not impressive compared to other W properties in other cities and countries but I understand this is quite the norm for Manhattan hotels. Apart from the relatively small size of the room, I felt that the lighting of the room is a little too dim. It is probably an extension of the supposedly hip and loungy design of the hotel. Further, the walkway from the lift to the room is also dimly lit. As a matter of fact, I thought it was a little too gloomy with light grey walls and metal doors.
If you generally prefer a room that is more cosy and cheerful, you will probably have to look elsewhere. But if you have a tight schedule in Manhattan, this is a sure bet for you to cover the quitessentials of Manhattan.",neutral,en
"This review is for the Dollar Rent a Car location at the MGM Grand:\n\nWe did a day-long rental from Dollar Rent a Car so that we could drive ourselves out to the Hoover Dam from the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. It was convenient to have the agency right in the main lobby of the hotel; that's the main reason we decided to rent from here.\n\nFirst the good: Our blue Ford Fusion was clean and well maintained. It was pretty easy to get to the cars, up on floor 5 of the MGM parking garage. \n\nNow, the bad: Both on key pickup and key return, I could not believe that there was only one attendant working the rental desk in the MGM lobby. It took almost an hour of waiting in line for us to get our keys. I had to wait for at least 20 minutes upon key return before the employee asked if anyone in line was waiting to simply drop their keys off.\n\nThe experience would have been a lot better if they thought about their staffing needs, especially during the busy weekend times. I don't know if there are better options elsewhere, but in the future I'd definitely consider just renting from the airport, even if it meant I had to take a cab over there to get the car.",negative,en

"I stayed at the Hyatt Embarcadero Wed. June 6 - Fri. June 8th on business for a conference rate of $200 (much less than the lowest $350 AAA rate I could find) booked through a special website. I must say that the hotel is large hotel with nice atrium in the middle with checkin on the second flor of the hotel with conference rooms on first level and below - setup is little strange. Strange meaning bars and main resturant on the same second level as checkin/registration desk and open air with rooms all facing inward. Very easy to get to from OAK airport using AirBART ($3 exact change each way) and BART train ($3.35 each way exact change or credit at tix machine) to the Embarcadero station stop. Now, on with my review.....
Checkin was breeaze with many checkin agents available, however not easy to switch rooms - at least for my conference and I am Platinum Passport level, so I was stuck with a third floor on the Market St. side standard room, and got to listen to the Market St buses idle all day & night, and saxophone musicians play the Godfather theme every single morning on the street at the crack of dawn.
Pros:
Early checkin was available
Can view hotel bill on room tv
Comfy beds with insulated walls- you do not hear your neighbors
Large tv's in room
iron and board in room
Good water pressure/hot water all times
Close to many restaurants for nice luches and dinners out
Cable line begins and ends right in front of hotel
Easy to get a cab
7-11 convenience store right across street for main entrance for snacks, water, gum, etc.
Starbucks directly across the street right next to the 7-11 cstore
Fast elevetors
Plentiful elevators - 6 if I remember correctly
10-15 minute walk to Union Square
Safe area to walk at night
Late checkout provided at checkin
Cons:
Expensive rooms
Maid came in room even when I put privacy card on door - luckily I was clothed and working at the desk
inernet access is $10 a day - 24 hour time begins when you activate
Expensive to drink and eat in hotel - better to walk to other places in area
Rooms are small for a Hyatt and the money
Staff not very friendly but efficient
Billing errors - I was charge for movies I did not order every nigh of my stay, but was corrected easily at front desk.
Lower floor rooms are very noisy through the window side of room
Bar was always closed - never any staff available in bar (many guests were complaining about bar being closed including some visitors meeting guests) NOTE: Bar on top floor of this hotel closed permanently at end of May.
Parking-Not sure about parking since I would not rent a car in SF unless paning to go out to wine country, but saw a logjam in front of hotel with some guests irriated in tie it took to get thier cars fro valet. I think hotel may be valet only also ( $30 - $50 per day and no in/out priviledges)
Lunch and dinner hotel food was not very good. Bfast was great.
Recommendations:
Stay somewhere else in Union Square area like the Westin for equal level of hotel rating or the Le Meridien near this Hyatt Emb.
Get a room on the highest floor possible above street noise
Do not get a room on the Market St side ) I believe room #'s that end in 01 - 12 are on that street. I was in Room # 308 which was not good due to street noise
Check your bill - mine had errors
Avoid breakfast in the hotel, great bfast food but pricey ($40 for buffet for one person) - Go to Max's Diner one block off Union Square for breakfast connected to the Maxwell Hotel (another review for me) on Geary St. instead
which is a 15 minute walk but worth it.
Bring ear plugs
Lunch and dinner food in hotel
I would not stay at this Hyatt again for business or personal travel.

"Today I had one scoop from 3 of Presto cafe's salads :\n1) Faro, asparagus, spring onion, radish, parmigiana reggiano, arugula, lemon. (pretty darn good and I honestly didn't expect to like this one very much.)\n2) Israeli couscous, wild mushrooms, Parmesan, lemon truffle (freaking AMAZING and I will gladly go back to enjoy this salad again!)\n3) Strawberry, arugula, apple, blue cheese, sherry (decent but I could have done without, it wasn't bad but it wasn't anything special.)\nAnd I finished it off with a regular Green Goodness smoothie (Apple, Avocado, Banana, Spinach, Kale, Ginger, Agave nectar.) It was pretty good, the girl at the counter told me it was their most popular one. I have never had a smoothie with kale in it and it wasn't off putting like I expected it might be. \nThe prices were very reasonable! The staff was friendly and helpful.\nI would recommend this place to anyone who had a long night or someone who just enjoys good healthy food.\nA great bonus is that kids eat free on Friday's after 4pm",positive,en

"This hotel seems to think it's a big chain, for all the right reasons. The staff at the front desk are all dressed in Porto Vista-branded outfits, professional, attractive and helpful. The hotel seems like an older hotel that was recently renovated and bought by new owners, who've added some hip touches, color schemes and outdoor lounging, and rebranded it the Porto Vista hotel. Now, this is what it seems- though this is just my opinion from staying there and not facts on the hotel. It has a rooftop lounge area that was closed during our May stay (weather wasn't ideal) but still open to check out and walk around. We enjoyed the rooftop views of the skyline, too. Speaking of weather, it has outdoor corridors which never proved a problem on our trip. It actually was nice since you get that nice San Diego breeze and it made it feel more neat like a beachfront hotel, even though we were several blocks from the coast. It also has an outside gathering area in the center courtyard of the hotel with a few outdoor sofas, tables, etc. that look they were furnished by CB2 and that make it ideal for a group gathering- maybe 10-15 friends sitting around, having a drink, chilling only steps from their rooms. Ok- for the rooms- they were average hotel size, maybe a little on the smaller side, with the sink and vanity separate from the comode/shower area (with a door for privacy). My room and my girlfriend's were a little different so they may have different layouts. My room did not have cups in there, but a quick late-night call to the front desk had a gentleman bring some right up. That was a nice surprise since I was just hoping they had some downstairs; I could go down and get them myself. The room was clean with no smells of smoke or mold (my big things). The extra nice touch was Terra Green (I think that's spelled right) bath products in the room. I had been given a few samples by a friend and really liked them. I had never seen them in a hotel before, so that was a nice touch. Ask housekeeping for extras! Our rooms had HBO and a premium channels; a nice touch. As far as deals, you may find a deal once in a while on Groupon, too. The breakfast, while not included with our rate, was good and filling, It's in a hip casual restaurant called The Glass Door with nice views on a higher floor, with both indoor seating and outdoor ""breakfast bar/high top-style"" seating available. All the chairs are silver and the wait staff is young and friendly. It does lack a certain amount of ""warmth"" in the restaurant, mainly because of the use of concrete and silver and chrome chairs and tables but that is not necessarily a negative depending on what you are looking for. The hotel also has a bar for drinks that we did not check out. There is an airport shuttle that is around ten dollars or so per person and was a nice alternative to a cab. What we did since we were flying out that afternoon is we stored our luggage with the front desk, returned our rental car and then hopped a cab to Balboa park. Just as an FYI that Park is great! It's like the Central Park of the West lol! While you can stroll through the park and find a bench or layout a blanket near the fountains, there are also science museums, art exhibits, a photographic museum, casual eateries, the San Diego Zoo, and more on the Park premises. We spent a few hours grabbing a bite and lounging by the fountains, not wanting our trip to end in a few hours. We could have easily spent the day there. Afterwards we hopped a cab back to the hotel, grabbed our luggage and off to the airport. The location of the hotel is great and it's within WALKING distance (even with heels, says my girlfriend) to Little Italy! We were only there at night where we got to eat at a great restaurant down there, but imagine it's probably neat to stroll during the day. The Little Italy section of town is neat and quite safe. Oh, and yes- there is Valet Parking at the the hotel, too. Helpful if you want to walk or cab around the city, or take public transit but still have your car available on demand. Valet is prompt and helpful, too. Great location, helpful staff, and slightly more hip than your standard motel vibe add up to a great value for the price. In fact, my girlfriend said if we go back to San Diego in a few years (neat city), she'd like to stay there again and look back on our trip from 2012. While the gaslamp area and the waterfront area seem like a good location for hotels, too- we would consider Porto Vista hotel again- as long as the weather, and of course price, are right. Enjoy San Diego!!",positive,en

Our only quibbles were the lack of bar soap to wash hands (but they gave us extra body wash when we asked) and the noise bleed-through from the room above... but I think our neighbours above were exceptionally noisy so it won't always be the case. Very helpful staff, they stored our luggage for us for the day of departure. Cupcakes and coffee were available in the lobby for breakfast...",positive,en

It's a walk up to the counter sort of place, you might want to stare at the menu overhead before getting in line and delaying everyone behind you as you try to make up your mind (sorry everyone!

"The Cal, where the waitresses know more about football than you! \n\nWell that's not entirely true, I know my football, but these ladies are pretty damn good. You know you are in the right place when a gorgeous cocktail waitress, counts her tips, gets off her shift, puts on a sweater, whips out a sports page and sits down at the sports book.\n\nMy wife and I play mainly bartop video poker, and by habit I usually sit near a waitress station. You seem to learn more about a place when you are close to the waitresses and bartenders. There are three good bars to play video poker at The Cal. My favorite is downstairs, I believe it is called Dave's bar. They have some nice flat screen poker, and decent progressives that are tied to every royal on the machine. \nThat is where a lot of the football talk goes on. \n\nOne of the waitresses is the commissioner of her own fantasy league, and bets pretty heavy on games. Most of the others are at least in a pool, or bet a little. If football is on, they are always talking about it. \n\nThe last time we were in Vegas (pre-X-mas 2007) I knew I wanted to make a bet on the Patriots vs. Miami game, but I wasn't sure which way to go. I made my wife walk down to the Cal with me, so I could see what the waitresses thought. They assured me the Pats would hand Miami their collective asses, but I didn't listen. I took Miami on the money line, I should have listened. Strange that I didn't, by all past indicators when cleavage talks, I listen. (Some of the waitresses at the Cal sport some very impressive although tasteful cleavage.) \n\nThe bars have Margarita/Daiquiri machines with different flavors. Apparently, when you mix a strawberry, and regular daiquiri it is called a Lava Flow. We renamed it a \""Four of a Kind.\"" Since we had just hit a few. When I asked my wife, \""what was the drink we renamed a four of a kind?\"" The bartender remembered us, and said, \""Oh that was a Lava Flow.\"" Pretty impressive really. Our previous trip was three months earlier. \n\nI love the Cal, and plan on joining the Golden Arm Club their as soon as I can stay on a craps table that long. (The Cal is world renown for its craps tables) \n\nEven though we have never been to Hawaii, my wife now roots for all things Hawaiian just because of the friends she has made gambling at The Cal. \n\nWe have never stayed at the hotel, but would consider it. We will surely be back soon. Cya soon Cal.",neutral,en

"4ème livre du Prix Ado. J'avais déjà lu un livre de cet auteur qui m'avait grandement plu. Je dois dire que pour celui-ci, je suis déçue. L'histoire me plaisait pourtant bien et me paraissait raccord avec l'actualité: un jeune garçon de 17 ans, obligé de vivre terré dans un abri souterrain. Si il sort? Il sera contaminé par une épidémie ou même pourra mourir de déshydratation à cause du réchauffement climatique. Classique et possible. En plus, on m'avait dit qu'il y avait de la romance! Tout pour me plaire! Hélas... J'ai trouvé que le début était trop enfantin et l'histoire trop clichée. On peut tout de même souligner les nombreux rebondissements qui mettent un peu de piment dans ce roman ainsi que ma réflexion personnelle sur le monde en devenir. Avis plutôt mitigé donc pour ce 4ème livre.",neutral,multilingual

"Believe me when I say this show is just plain hilarious. The basic story is about Kintaro Oe who travels from town to town taking part time jobs, chasing women, and learning all he can about life. Kintaro has to be one of the easiest to relate to characters ever made. He takes everything to the extreme, and it's just laugh out loud funny every time. From his constant never ending quest to study life, to tiny things he instantly blows up into life or death matters.One of the funniest things about this show is simply Kintaro's constantly extremely over the top expressions and reactions. He spends a great amount of time in various super deformed modes like Dragon Half or Trigun. Other times in less then 0.1 seconds his face will turn not just serious, but manga-fighter-style life or death expressions like a weight lifter trying to benchpress a new record. It's hilarious.If that wasn't enough, the writing is superb and the english voice acting couldn't possibly be better. Kintaro's English VA is just perfect and will have you rolling around when he's not even really saying anything. The one thing to mention though is this is without a doubt an Ecchi series. It practically defines the word. If you're an adult anime fan who can get a laugh out of movies like American Pie, you'll love this.- Rirath_com",positive,en

最初のTVシリーズのアルバムが大好きで、今でも思い出して口ずさんでしまうほど特別な思いを持っています。 二人のシェリルとランカとしての新曲を長らく待ち望んでいたので、素直に嬉しかった。 菅野よう子さんも、かなり多忙に活動されているし、１0年以上経つようなアニメの曲を、いまさら書いてくれることはないなぁと思っていたので、これも小さな衝撃であった。 しかし、時間が空き過ぎた。 May'nさんも、愛さんも、それぞれの活動をしているのだし、再現できているのだろうか。 いや、１０年経ったその成長を見せてくれたほうが、腑に落ちるというものだ。 今回のミニアルバムは、劇場版のハイテンションな曲をそのまま引きずったものであり、最初のアルバムのような豊かな表現を感じることができなかった。 以前のように、二人の個性を最大限に引き出しつつ、キャラクターとリンクするような曲作りを求めます。 二人のことが好きな気持ちは今でも変わりません。 沢山のアニソンが乱発されるなか、本気のプロデュースをしてもらいたいと思います。,neutral,ja

منذ الوهلة الأولى التي التقطت عيناي عنوان الرواية أرجوك اعتن بأمي ، و أنا أتلهف لقراءتها؛ و ليتني لم أفعل للحالة العاطفية التي أوصلتني إليها. فهي رواية تتحدث عن جزء حساسي جدا من حياة كل إنسان، و حساسي خاصة لحد جنوني في حياتي. لذلك، و أنا أقرأ، كنت أحاول كثيرا أن لا أتأثر لندب في داخلي تثيره الرواية في مواضيع كثيرة تطرقت إليها. كنت أحاول أن أقرأ من غير أن أخلط كياني بها، أن أقرأ الرواية لألمها لا لألم ألم بي مذ زمن بعيد. كنت أحاول جاهدة أن لا أبدو مثيرة للشفقة أمام الرواية، أمام الجرح و الأسى الذي ترمي به قراءها بشكل لا يبدو منها أي اهتمام. كنت أحاول كثيرا، و نجحت إلا قليلا في ذلك.. أرجوك اعتن بأمي، طرحت الكاتبة كيونغ سوك شين فيها العديد من القضايا، معظمها مبطنة، و قليل منها جلية. غير أن محورها الأساسي لم يكن أن المرء منا يدرك قيمة الأشياء بعدما يفقدها كما اعتقد معظم الذين قرأوا الرواية، و إنما كانت تتحدث عن أن المرء سيقع في ألم غدق في حين يجعل من قيمة الأشياء بديهية لديه، دون أن يعتني بها، دون أن يعبر لها أن قيمتها تعني له شيئا مهما في حياته، لا مجرد قيمة بديهية حتمية.. فالمرء منا مهما يكن، يدرك قيمة الأشياء لديه، غير أن معظمنا يجعل من قيمة الأشياء بديهية لديه، و تمضي الحياة به دون أن يعبر عن أهمية تلك الأشياء لديه إلا في حين أن يفقدها. عندئذ، ينزاح عنه تلك البداهة و يلتفت للقيمة التي كانت لديه فيما سبق بديهية حتمية؛ و هذا ما لا يسعفه في شيء، فحين يقفد المرء منا الأشياء القيمة لديه، يكون الوقت قد فات عن اللحاق بها للتعبير عن أهميتها قبل أن تفقد. و هذا ما كانت تذكره لنا الرواية بشكل مؤلم يفطر القلب جيدا.. الكوريون الجنوبيون، يتميزون عن كل شعوب العالم في استثارة مشاعرك أيا كانت تلك المشاعر سلبيا أم إيجابية، و أيا كانت وسائل استثارتهم لمشاعرك إما عن طريق مسلسل، فيلم، رواية، مشهد، قصة، أغنية... إلخ، و أيا كانت أسباب استثارة مشاعرك أيضا، أكانت سببا تافها، جديا، أيا يكن. إنهم جيدون جدا في ذلك متفوقون عن كل بقية شعوب العالم. رغم أنه في مرات تلاحظ أن مشاعرك أثيرت لأسباب تافهة، و أحيانا أسباب حقيقية بحتة إلا أن بعيدا عن الأسباب و الوسائل، الكوريون الجنوبيون، جيدون جدا حقا في استثارة المشاعر، و جعل كل شيء عاطفي بشكل جنوني. و كانت الكاتبة كذلك في الرواية، إذ أن الرواية منذ الوهلة الأولى، من العنوان، الغلاف، تثير فيك كآبة. و حين تشرع في القراءة شيئا فشيئا، يغشى عليك كم هائل من الكآبة، الحزن، الأسى، الخوف، و الشفقة. و لا تدري حتى لم يحدث ذلك معك؟. و مع ذلك، في حين أن الكاتبة تبين للقارئ بشكل جلي لحد ما في بداية الرواية عن سبب تسمية الرواية بذلك، و القصة الرئيسية أيضا. إلا أن الكاتبة كانت تجبر القارئ دون جهد منه أن يكمل القراءة بأسلوب ذكي منها، و المشاعر التي كانت تبثه في القارئ، دون أن يدرك حتى هو لماذا يكمل القراءة في حين أنه يعلم القصة بأكملها من بداية صفحات الرواية؟ ففي كل مرة كانت الكاتبة تمنح القارئ فكرة غريبة عن ما سبق و قرأه، تجبره على اكمال القراءة للتأكد عن تلك الفكرة في حين يستمر في القراءة تمنحه فكرة أخرى من جديد. حتى يصل القارئ لنهاية الرواية و هو في عجب عن ما قد قرأه.. غير ذلك، كانت الكاتبة جيدة جدا في تركيب الشخصيات دون أن تضع وجودها في الرواية. فحين يقرأ القارئ الرواية يجد كيف تصف له الكاتبة المواقف من عدة زوايا يرى منها الشخوص الموقف ذاته من عدة زوايا، دون أن تبعث في نفس القارئ وجودها القسري اطلاقا. فيقرأ القارئ الموقف ذاته من عدة زوايا دون أن يشعر و كأنه يعيد قراءة الموقف. في حين كانت الشخوص تتحدث عن المواقف من زوايا و بطرق مختلفة تماما. و هذه مقدرة إبداعية في الروايات، و ليس من السهل صناعتها في الرواية، إذ إنها تتطلب جهدا و إدراكا جيدا و إبداعا كبيرا. و هذا يمنح الرواية تقييما ايجابيا كبيرا جدا.. غير أن الرواية كانت متقطعة في بعض المرات القليلة. فالتنقل بين مقاطع الرواية في القراءة رغم سلاستها الكبيرة، إلا أنها في مرات قليلة جدا لا تذكر، كانت تنقطع الفكرة في ذهن القارئ أثناء تلك الانتقالات. مما لم يؤثر سلبيا بشكل كبير على الرواية.. كذلك، كون أن الرواية لم تكن جذابة جدا في العشر الأول منها كجاذبيتها في بقية الرواية، أساءت إلا تقييمها سلبا. كون أن معظم القراء توقفوا عن قراءة الرواية، لأن العشر الأول منها لم تكن بالكفاءة و الإبداع الذي كانت عليه بقية الرواية. كانت لا تبدي للقارئ ماهيتها و قيمتها الحقيقة. إذ أن القيمة الحقيقة للرواية و ماهيتها كانت جلية جدا في بقية الرواية، باستثناء عشرها الأول و الذي أصاب معظم القراء بالسأم و اللا هدف من قراءتها.. رغم كل ذلك، من النادر أن تجد رواية تعليمية، دون أن تفقد معلوماتها أهمية الرواية أدبيا. و هذه الرواية كانت جدا ناجحة في ذلك. فهي من الروايات التي تحتوي على كم هائل من الدروس و المواعظ دون أن تفقد الرواية جمالها الأدبي و تحولها إلا مادة علمية، كما يقع معظم كتاب الروايات الذين يرغبون في جعلها رواياتهم تعليمية. فهذه الرواية، أدبية، أكثر بكثير من كونها علمية تعليمية، رغم أن بها كم هائل من المعلومات التعليمية، من دروس و مواعظ بعضها جلي، و أكثرها مبطن. و هذا جعل من الرواية تستحق جزءا كبيرا من التقييم الإيجابي.. بعيدا عن كل هذا، فكرة أن تجعل الكاتبة التحدث عن كل شخص من شخوص الرواية بضمير خاص به. إذ أن الرواية كانت مقسمة على أربع أقسام، و كل قسم منها مخصصة لشخص من الشخوص اللأربعة الأساسية، عدا القسم الرابع الذي تجتمع فيه الخاتمة مع احدى الشخوص. كانت الكاتبة، قد استخدمت ضميرا خاصا بكل شخص من الشخوص في القسم المخصص التحدث عنه؛ و هذا كان يمنح الرواية ترتيبا و جمالا بهيا حقا.. مع كل ذلك، لم يسبق لي و أن قرأت رواية دامية كهذه. ففي كل مرة يشعر فيها القارئ بالحزن يظهر له شعور و كأن الكاتب يخبره بأن الألم الحقيقي لم يأتي حينه بعد؛ و أن بقية الرواية أشد ألما. فيشرع القارئ في المضي قدما، و في كل مرة يشعر بالأسى، يراوده شعور بأن الأكثر مأساة لم يحن بعد. فالكاتبة كانت ممتازة جدا في أن تخاطب القارئ عاطفيا. و تستثيره عاطفيا قبل كل شيء، و قبل أن يغرق معها في الرواية و ما هدفت إليه حتى.. و لأن الرواية من الروايات الثقيلة الدسمة بشكل هائل، فهي ليست لكل القراء. فالقارئ المبتدئ، القارئ البسيط، ربما لن يجد فيها شيئا يستحق القراءة. لكن، أنصح القراء بقراءتها في جلسة واحدة. غير ذلك، ستصيبك الرواية بالضجر إذ أنت توقفت عن القراءة و عدت إليها لاستكمال القراءة فيها. لأنها في حقيقة الأمر هي من الروايات التي لا تتضح ماهيتها إلا باكتمال قراءتها و التهامها دفعة واحدة.,positive,ar

"Stayed here for one night on a business trip last week. Made my reservation online as I know the Galleria area is nice and would offer things to do and places to eat within walking distance.
I was put on 3rd floor, right by a stairwell facing a concrete parking garage. I was frustrated as I could not get my drapes to stay all the way closed so I had to change in the bathroom and had an overwhelming feeling that people could see in my room as they were parking their cars throughout the night. Fun! The headlights coming in my room were at all hours were really fun too. Too bad I was already completely unpacked by the time I realized these two issues after dark or I would have made them change me to another room.
Also, the bathroom door in my room blocked the front door completely. One would think that this is a fire hazard as if you left it open during the night, you would not be able to get to the door to exit quickly.
For the price, it was a decent stay and convenient location; however, do keep in mind if you're traveling as a family and or children, you may have to do a little explaining as the hotel bumps up to a strip club right next door with high traffic in the evening.
Overall the accomodations were clean, fairly quiet (minus people in the stairwell) but basic. The fresh baked cookies at the check-in desk were a nice touch and made the whole lobby smell like a warm vanilla candle.......but that's where my warm and fuzzy feeling ended - the lobby.
Will try another property in the area next time I'm in Houston.",neutral,en
"If you ever feel the need for ill-prepared food in a funeral-home-esque atmosphere, this place is for you. The last time I was here it was when a visiting scholar was in town, so someone got the bright idea of bringing her here. We loaded up our plates with watery cottage cheese and wilted lettuce and sat down. The conversation kind of mimicked the food: bland and predictable. Maybe you'll have better luck, but man, I thought this was just about the worst place on campus to eat. (See my review for the Krannert cafe, which is at least do-able.)",negative,en

"I stayed two nights for business and was looking forward to my stay as generally reviews were fantastic. And the hotel is fine, good in fact - but not amazing.
Check in was efficient but brusque and I was impressed with the room. I had a two bedded queen room. Very comfortable bed and a good size. Very nice bathroom with an excellent shower.
There is a good desk space for work but internet is charged (wifi or cable). It connected easily but the cost is high. It was slow for downloading but OK for e mails etc.
I was disappointed in breakfast. This was poor compared to other US hotels I have stayed in. An unfriendly waiter, very few choices and a very disappointing experience with very mediocre food. For $25. I would definitely take a short walk as there are many places to have a better breakfast in the immediate area.
My other disappointment was room servicing. I had used the coffee maker but milk, coffee etc were not replenished. Towels were not replaced in the bathroom.
The concierge was excellent however.
I ate in the restaurant again for dinner to give them am second chance. Service was more friendly but again I felt disappointed in the food. It was OK - certainly not awful - but I think I would head out to find somewhere better.
So overall it was very good but disappointed me a little in some respects.",neutral,en

"This hotel is in an excellent location: walking distance to Columbus Park, Faneuill Hall, Quincy Market, Aquarium. Lots of nearby historic sites as well, such as the Boston Massacre memorial, Meeting house. The staff was wonderful, very accomodating. I arrived early on a Sunday when they were full, and normal check-in isn't until 3 pm. I waited in the lobby (comfy couches) and they had a room ready for me within 30 minutes.
However....the complimentary internet did not work 2 of the 3 days I was there. After spending 45 minutes on the phone with their support group, the only possible explanation they came up with was that their bandwidth was being totally used, as the hotel was full. C'mon, this was one of the reasons I chose this hotel!!! Also, I had one of the atrium rooms. It was too dark, even with all of the lights on, and depressing. Noise from the lobby and hallway also traveled up the atrium. Another negative: although there was coffee and tea in the lobby, I really prefer making my own so it's ready when I get out of the shower. Also, they lobby is undergoing renovation, so it's down to bare walls and ceiling studs.",negative,en

"Am very impressed at how fast the food kept coming even tho it was close to full capacity at lunch time. The staff were attentive and extremely polite and helpful.Highlights: the pu er milk tea was heavenly. The fried rice was fragrant and mightily tasty. The jelly fish appetiser dish was also a delight.Let-downs: the spicy shrimp Wan Ton (Hong you Chao Shou) has too little meat and were lacking in taste. The ginseng chicken was also mediocre - meat was hard and the soup rather bland. The chocolate Xiao long Bao was hard (pales in comparison to ones that I got from the DTF in city square JB two days go). Avoid the pork chop with a ten foot pole, it was uninspiring and bland.Hopefully if we come back during non peak hour, the food quality would be a bit better...",neutral,en

"FINALLY, a place to satiate my ramen needs! Potato croquette! Curry katsu! There is hope for the Charlotte Asian dining scene! \n\nYes, the previous reviews are spot on-- authentic Japanese (minus the obligatory California roll and special sushi rolls) in a super charming space (Don't be thrown off by it's location next to the Little Caesars.) with friendly family-run service.)\n\nThis place is packed with fellow Asians (not the speed-racing kind like Ru San's) which is always a good sign. \n\nTIP: Get the lunch special A or B. You'll see examples of A and B at the front of the restaurant. The special is $8 and is plenty of food. (Last time, it was a curry katsu bowl and a bowl of miso ramen. The other was a mini version of the dinner bento box.) \n\nTo the reviewers who had poor sushi experiences, claiming the rolls are similar to the pre-packaged ones at the supermarket, and un-fresh: I urge you to try Musashi again. I always find the rice perfect and room-temperature and seasoned well. Also: to those who complain the sushi menu is small, yes, it's less than a page. However, who wants a phone-book-sized-menu if the food isn't good? \n\n(If you want to talk supermarket sushi, DYK restaurants like Soul Gastrolounge actually serve the supermarket brand as their own...and nobody knows! In fact, it's pretty good, considering.) \n\nI also don't think the service is unfriendly at all! Maybe being busy and task-oriented (not taking time to chit-chat) is mistaken for unfriendliness...I duno, I just call it efficient! \n\nTIP #2: You can't get their udon or ramen to-go.\n\nBottom Line: If you're accustomed to some noodle houses in New York or LA, or in cities with large Asian communities, no, this place isn't going to be on the same level-- but sometimes you don't need all the frills. Just a solid meal, run by a family you can tell knows what they're doing.",positive,en
"Another Hyatt Place hotel, although this one is brand new and next to a comparable Marriott Springhill Suites of similar size. \n\nThis Hyatt Place is in Tempe, a few miles from Sky Harbor Airport (PHX) and close to Arizina State University, a few miles from Downtown Phoenix and Tempe, and close to several freeways to get you elsewhere in the Valley of the Sun. However, it is not a downtown location, so you need to get a car or have someone pick you up. There is a free shuttle to the airport, however. \n\nOne of the best things about this new concept in business hotels is that each room has an HDTV 42 inch LG plasma TV.And the programming has several HD digital channels available. You can also order DirecTV Sports packages for a day in High Def. \n\nThe other great thing about this new hotel brand is that they are actively trying to attract business customers. So if you stay 2 times, you will earn a free night, and get a 2,500 point winter bonus. I have already used this twice, so it is a good deal. \n\nI got a Fri/Sat weekend rate of only $99/nite, for a plush king size bed with free breakfast, and HDTV. Pretty good deal.",negative,en

同じサイズの旧型を何年も使っています。とうとう蓋が壊れたので新しくこの商品を購入しました. 以前の型と違ってカートリッジの底部分が筒抜けになっていてカートリッジからダイレクトに水が落ちます。 蓋がパカッと開くので水が入れ易く、蓋を持っていたりどこかに置く必要もないので衛生的でいいですね。 商品には全く問題なく、水道水が確実に飲みやすくなります。お米を炊くのも料理にも重宝しています。 でも今回最初に頼んだ所（マーケットプレイス出品者・新品で販売）から中古が届いてびっくりしました。 箱から出すとビニールに入っておらず、カートリッジは開封されてセットされていて中身の黒いのが出て蓋が少し黒ずんでいました。 外側には黄色いソースのシミが3点ついていて、全体的に水しぶきの跡が…。 気持ち悪くてとりあえず写真を撮って、そのまま箱に戻して速攻で返品しました。 それでもこの商品は必要なので、Amazonから直接買いました。50円安かっただけなのに失敗した！と思いました。 プライムですぐに届いたけど返品することになり、プライムの意味なかったな～と。 その業者からはお詫びも何も連絡もないです。ちゃんとそれなりの評価をつけました。 ちなみにAmazonから届いた新品は箱から出すと本体がちゃんとビニールに入っていて、カートリッジにもビニールと水色のテープ（粉がこぼれないよう）がしてありました。,positive,ja

"I usually am not interested in going to Jet when I'm in town but my friend had a hook-up for buy 2 bottles, get 1 free, so we decided to do it. When I first walked up, I was so not impressed by the people standing in line...totally ghetto but there was a huge line. It helps to be on the guest-list and/or do bottle service. My group was pretty big with 8 guys and 4 girls. With this ratio, to get in without waiting in line, we set it up so that the 8 guys were buying 2 bottles and we put the 4 girls on the guestlist to get in free. Someone we knew, knows a bartender that was able to do that. I don't know what the regular cost is for the 2 bottles but we did get one free on top of that. In Vegas, you gotta ask around, network, make friends, etc to get the best deals/hook-ups. Anyway, we all got in easily with this set-up. Once inside, the club itself is decorated pretty nicely with candled walls, lights on the ceiling and stripper-poles throughout the dancefloor. The space is medium sized, not small but not huge either. The music was really good, a mix of Hip Hop and some House. We got a table right next to the dancefloor. Our bottle service girl was pretty friendly (they aren't always) and attentive, refilling the mixers, ice, and cups often. Later in the night, she told my husband she could do buy one bottle, get one if we wanted more, so we did. We got a second bottle of Jack ($450 plus tax + 20% gratuity). In total, we bought 3 bottles and got 2 free, so 5 total. More friends showed up, we got the two tables next to us since they opened up. And ended up partying 25 people deep. It was a good time. \n\nThe place was totally packed, uncomfortably packed. If we didn't have a table, I'd be pissed off. The couple of times I walked to the bar and bathroom, I was squished to death. The crowd is mostly 20-somethings, so it's a bit younger and all ethnicities. My only gripe is that there were really nasty chicks on the stripper poles. I thought the poles were going to break. It was NOTcute!

"Zwei Stück Sahnetorte sind eindeutig zu viel
Inhaltsangabe: Carla Brandner ist 30 geworden und immer noch auf der Suche nach ihrem Traummann. Im neuen Lebensjahr soll es endlich so weit sein, sie will ihn finden. Ihr guter Freund Leo hat eine Idee: Für jedes Stück Sahnetorte, das sie zu ihrem Geburtstag isst, soll sie einen Mann zum Verlieben kennenlernen. Sie lernt einige männliche Exemplare kennen, aber ist darunter auch der eine? Die eine Sahneschnitte? Meine Meinung: Der Schreibstil der Autorin hat mich sofort begeistert. Die Figuren werden sehr lebendig beschrieben. Man ist gleich in der Geschichte drin und hat sogar das Gefühl irgendwie dabei zu sein. Die Figuren wachsen einem sehr schnell ans Herz. Es wird aus der Sicht von Carla geschrieben. Man fiebert mir ihr mit, den einen zu finden. Es ist ziemlich realistisch geschildert. Als sich das Buch dem Ende näherte, war ich ein kleines bisschen enttäuscht. Normalerweise mag ich solche Reihen nicht besonders, bei denen es Band für Band weiter geht und man immer so lange auf den nächsten Teil warten muss. Da es hier schon den zweiten Teil gibt, konnte ich gleich nahtlos weiterlesen und wurde mit jeder Zeile in bisschen mehr zum Carla-Fan. Mein Fazit: Das Buch (die Reihe) ist sehr empfehlenswert. Ich habe lange nicht mehr so eine schöne Geschichte in dem Genre gelesen. Dafür vergebe ich 5+ Sterne.",positive,de

"My friend and I kidnapped our wives and took them for a long weekend to New York City from Pheonix, AZ. I had made arragements to stay at the Wellington Hotel. Upon arrival, we were told that a large group had unexpectantly extended their stay and we were being moved to a sister property. I was not happy, as I was sure this would be a downgrade. I could not have been more wrong!
The Blakely is located about a half a block away from the Wellington. We walked down and went to the small check in desk in the very nice lobby. We gave the clerk the letters of introduction from the Wellington. That was when he told us that all transfers from the Wellington were being upgrade to suites!
All I can say is wow. We were place in a double queen bed suite on the 4th floor. The suite had a small bathroom with shower/tub and full sink done in marble tile. Very nice. The sitting room had two chairs and a sleeper sofa with a flat screen TV. A small side area had the coffee pot and a fully stocked mini fridge. The spacious bedroom had 2 queen beds and another flat screen tv. The view was of a parking lot behind the hotel, but we never looked out the window that much anyway.
The cleaning staff was courtious and efficient. The room was always cleaned and the bathroom expendables were always replaced.
The free breakfast was good and filling. We never had a problem with seating and the staff was very good.
The front desk staff and the doormen were very knowlegable and friendly. They recommended a small Italian place (Nocello) that was very, very good.
The location is close to transporation (subway and bus) and easy walking distance from Times Square and Central Park.
We had a great time and would highly recommend this place to others.",positive,en

So when I thought about mill nightlife the only tempting place was The Big Bang. Finally I tried it out and was more entertained than I expected. \n\nFor a Thursday the place wasn't too bad. By 11 there was a pretty big crowd with enough waitresses around to liquor you up enough to be creative with requests. I chose \""Benny and the Jetts\"" which they played immediately and \""I'd Rather Fuck You\"" by Easy E. To my surprise they gave it a shot and didn't do too bad. Even though they played the hilariously vulgar Easy tune they lost points by not saying Happy Birthday to my friend who was there with me to celebrate. So much for tipping nowadays. The bartender didn't know many drinks when I asked for suggestions but that's understandable with two years of bartending under your belt. Max. \n\nIn summary GREAT TUNES \n\nAverage Bar",negative,en

"В декабре 2019 г. мы зарегестрировали нашу Организацию, и естсественно встал вопрос об открытии расчетного счета. Как показала практика найти Банк для дистанционной работы очень не просто... Первый Банк который вышел в поисковой строке был С...Банк, но когда мы почитали условия обслуживания и послушали отзывы других организаций, данный банк у нас сразу отпал , далее был долгий процесс изучения и прочтения отзывов о других банках. И наконец-то мы наткнулись на сайт Банка Точка! После звонка в банк мы были несказанно рады, что договор обслуживания можо заключить дистанционно, ведь мы находимся территориально удаленно от крупных городов и в нашем городе всего два банка. Процесс заключения договора был очень прост, мы связались по видеосвязи с сотрудником Банка и после нашего общения и предоставления копий документов, нам открыли расчетный счет. Обслуживание в Банке потрясающее, специалисты на связи 24 7 и не только на телефонной линии, но и в чате в приложении и на сайте. Сотрудники готовы помочь по любому вопросу, даже не входящему в их компетенцию. Отдльное СПАСИБО специалистам - Вы большие молодцы)))Пополнение расчетного счета возможно через банкоматы сторонних Банков и при этом комиссия не взымается, что является отдельным плюсом. Деньги на расчетные счета физических и юридических лиц перечислются быстро. Проблем со 115-ФЗ ни разу не было, в отличии от сторонних Банков, которые пытаются блокировать работу счетов по любому поводу и без повода. Кроме того в Банке есть кешбэк, причем данный кешбэк можно конвертировать как в рубли (причем курс 1 1), так и получить сертификаты на сумму у партнеров Банка. Хотелось бы, чтоб кешбэк можно было тратить на комиссию за пополнения счета сверх лимита, это просьба к сотрудникам Банка) В целом могу сказать, что стоит открыть расчетный счет в Банке Точка и снять с себя хотябы часть проблем, ведь при ведении бизнеса забот и без того хватает!",positive,ru

"The San Jose is probably one of the nicest and certainly the most distinctive hotel in Austin. Austin is not awash in great hotels - lots of humdrum chains and older properties save for the Four Seasons - so the place is a breath of fresh air. It's well located on South Congress along an eclectic strip of shops (galleries, vintage furniture), restaurants, and clubs. It is adjacent to a popular coffee bar run by the hotel and just down the block from El Sol y la Luna, a popular Mexican restaurant.
I love the design - very well done, very Austin, very environmentally sensitive. The rooms are in a few buildings arranged around a courtyard that has a small pool (I mean SMALL) and an area with tables and chairs. The courtyard attracts a bit of a scene, not at all loud and very much reflective of the laid-back vibe for which Austin is justly known.
My gripes are two: the minimalism of the rooms and the price. I say this from someone who loves modern design and enjoys boutique hotels if they are comfortable, but this felt a little like a cell (and mine was a deluxe room). As you'll see from my pictures, room features include a poured cement floor, outdoor patio runners used as rugs, and a single wooden shelf that serves as a shelf in lieu of a dresser (there is a small drawer next to the open closet in the bathroom. There are sliding doors leading to a simple bathroom. My room also had a small private patio which was handsome but not really very useful.
If this was $89 a night I'd sing the hotel's praises. Since my roon was $189 a night, I won't. It's just way overpriced, and I say this as a New Yorker who is used to paying high prices for just about everything. The only thing that justifies this is the demand; it's obviously popular, especially with a younger crowd.
A few other random notes: There was also a bit of snootiness at the front desk. The parking lot is crowded; I often got the last parking space and it's a tight fit. They have great bathroom amenities (maybe this is why they charge so much). My deluxe room off to a corner was quiet, but I hear that rooms facing the courtyard or street can be loud.",negative,en

"Great place to stay!\nMy girlfriend and I stayed here over a long weekend (Thurs-Sun) and had an excellent time. The rooms were nice & spacious, with a mini-kitchen (other rooms have different/better amenities), and comfortable beds/furniture. This place would be ideal for a family or people who are looking for a more laid back Vegas experience. \n\nThe main thing that drew our eye to the Tahiti Village was the pool and lazy river. The pictures on their website make it look pretty spectacular and it definitely lived up to the hype. The pool had music playing & a water-volleyball match going on with a lively group of guests. \n\nThe only draw back were drink prices at the poolside bar. I understand there's an up-charge, I get it... but when my girlfriend comes back after ordering drinks for her & I and says she doesn't have enough cash and I ask how much... hearing \""$38..that's before tip,\"" I was ready to simply go thirsty. $19 for a mixed drink is absolutely ridiculous! I even saw the resort management hassle a time-share owner about bringing beers down to the pool (beers that he had purchased at the resort's on-site store). But aside from that, an excellent place to stay!\n\nThe shuttle service to the strip is convenient & pretty prompt. There was no way I was waking up at 8am to catch the shuttle to the grocery store on Friday morning though, so I ended up walking. There's a Food 4 Less about 1.6 miles away (straight shot down South Las Vegas Blvd). However, in 109 degree heat (even with 0 humidity), it's not the most pleasant stroll. So, my \""pro tip\"" for anyone else in the same boat, cut through the HUGE outlet mall that's on the way. It's air conditioned and it covers nearly 1/3 of the distance you're going to be traveling. \n\nAlso, when looking online, it said the only real places for food were the restaurant at the resort (Tahiti Joe's) or Denny's (also located on the resort property). However, just passed the strip mall, there are a number of other eatery options. From subway & fast food to sit-down restaurants & night clubs, you can find a variety of options. \n\nAll in all, as long as you're slightly resourceful, Tahiti Village was a great stay. The resort staff was polite and did an excellent job. They even let us have late check out because our flight wasn't until 9pm that night. \n\nHad a blast, will be back again!",neutral,en

"Частенько с коллегами наблюдали движение туристического трамвая по Садовой, хотелось тоже прокатиться на нем. И вот, в один из дней, купили на сайте музея билеты, с трепетным чувством дождались даты поездки и отправились, как нам казалось, в небольшое удивительное путешествие. Однако, удивительным это путешествие не оказалось. Трамвайчик внутри на вид уютный, но двойные сиденья неудобные - короткие. Если сидеть на длинных сиденьях, расположенных вдоль вагона, неудобно смотреть на объекты, которые находятся за спиной. Гид рассказывала о достопримечательностях, мимо которых мы проезжали вблизи , а также о тех, которые находились где-то слева/справа в далеке по ходу трамвая. Информации было так много, и она подавалась настолько неинтересно, что мозг включил защитную реакцию - люди стали засыпать. Выйти пофотографировать прекрасный город с места экскурсии на остановках, которые зачем-то объявлялись, было нельзя. В результате, добрая половина народа попросилась уйти с экскурсии на середине маршрута. Кроме этого, хочется отметить, что заявленная цена - 500 рублей - для такой экскурсии, завышена, отсутствие льготных билетов также не прибавляет бонусов музею.

"Wow! one of the best italian restaurants I've been to in Vegas.\n\nFirst of all, I must say the service here is GREAT! The servers made sure you had everything you needed. Even though it was a busy night, the servers did not disappoint.\n\nThe food was delicious! I really recommend the \""Scialatielli Ai Quattro Passi\"" pasta. It's a thick pasta, kinda like really fat spaghetti with a bolognese red sauce. The pasta was cooked al dente and the sauce was tossed and combined with the pasta perfectly. The portions was huge and was definitely sharable.\n\nThe grilled pork chop and honey glazed belly was very good also. They usually cook the pork chop to medium, which is a little rare for my taste. I would ask for medium well or well. This dish could be a tad sweet with the glaze and the apple marmalade. But overall, the flavors combine nicely with the saltiness of the chop and the sweetness of the glaze. The chop can be a on the fatty side so beware.\n\nThe \""Salsiccia & Broccoli\"" pizza was on the bland side. The home made sausage had a mild flavor which didn't work too well with the pizza. The Rapini/Broccoli was more bitter than I expected. This was the only disappointment, though I'm sure the other pizzas have potential to be yummy. \n\nIf you still have room for dessert, you must have the Tiramisu. I usually don't like tiramisu made with lady fingers because it's usually dry. But this was one of the better tiramisu's I've had. It had the right amount of coffee flavor, richness from the cheese, and sweetness from the chocolate glaze.\n\nOverall, this was VERY pleasant meal and can't wait to come back.",positive,en

We had a reservation on a Saturday night, and were seated quickly. The menu is all ala carte. I had the Prime Rib, potatoes, and asparagus. I ordered my prime rib medium well, and it came out very well done (no pink whatsoever). My friend ordered his Prime Rib medium and it was rare (bloody). You'd think for a $38 steak they could get it right. I will say the cuts were nice and think (14oz), but the flavor wasn't anything I haven't already tasted at most steak houses. The asparagus and yukon gold mashed however, were very very tasty. Another person in our party got the surf and turf and the filet was very small. There was also a hair in their side order of mushrooms (we were given free creme brulee for this). It was an okay experience, but for the price ($500 for dinner for 6 people without alcohol), I'd expect near perfection.",negative,en

"Vegas is expensive and let's not kid ourselves, but we also try to spend as little as possible. That is why there are places like Fremont and off the strip buffets.

Your experience might be different from mine but here's how it worked.\nYou see the pizza you want through the glass plus anything you see on their menu. At first I thought they were going to cut out a slice from what has been sitting out in the open. Instead, the four of us waited and received FRESH PIZZA SLICES from the oven, three different kinds of slices. Were they amazing? You bet your A$$ they were! MAYBE it was because it was slow when we arrived, that might explain why they had the time to make fresh slices for us. Who knows? The service of course was friendly and warm welcoming. It's sad, the more I think about it, the next time I visit Vegas, there is no way that I am going to miss out on Pop Up Pizza.

"I almost saw this at an actual movie theatre (an art-house theatre, no less!) but couldn't make it there in the one whole week it played, but yesterday I finally saw it on cable and...well...I wasn't disappointed, that's for sure! Madonna has done it again: YET ANOTHER BOMB! When will this woman learn? When will the studios learn? (Or perhaps they already have, since this film was largely dumped, with little fanfare and deadly word-of-mouth.) One would hope that being directed by her talented husband, who's created some interesting and/or terribly entertaining work, would bring out the same quality Madonna showed in ""Desperately Seeking Susan""; alas, it just isn't meant to be, for here she is, at her very worst: singularly convinced of her own greatness, the smugness permeating every frame she's in, made all the more unbearable by her wavering faux-British accent, an accent that only underscores the fact that her speaking voice is immature in quality and not especially pleasant. This may sound unnecessarily cruel but LISTEN to the woman, and LOOK at her films of, say, the past decade: like a latter-day Bette Davis, there is an unmistakable brittleness to not only her carriage but to her very face and body, which here, despite the warm photography displayed throughout the film (perhaps its only saving grace), are done no favors. To her credit, the entire affair is so misbegotten that one wonders if the world's greatest actress on her best day could do anything with this mess. No one involved escapes unharmed: Bruce Greenwood actually seems pained to be on-screen, though poor Jeanne Tripplehorn seems to carry herself as if she's actually in something good, which had me thinking all the while, ""Denial ain't just a river in Egypt!"" Adriano Giannini, son of Giancarlo Giannini, star of the Italian original, ""Swept Away..."", is, like his father before him, immensely attractive, and isn't altogether bad (despite winning a Razzie nomination for ""Worst Actor""), but, like almost everything else about this production, it all comes back to Madonna, on whose shoulders rest the blame. Why her? Why not her husband, director Guy Ritchie? Just who do YOU think was behind this remake? What actress wouldn't want nearly every shot of a movie to be centered on her, with only a relative nobody sharing the screen? Oh sure, Ritchie deserves some blame: surely he - or someone - ANYONE! - should have, and could have, taken his lead aside and insisted on something bordering on ACTUAL FEELING in her line readings (for her performance is so wooden it's a surprise the rest of the cast didn't get splinters), or at least display a semblance of warmth...but she seems resistant to be anything but a cinematic black hole. Above and beyond anything else, this is strictly a vanity project for its star so she is ultimately accountable for it. A film like this, an ""Odd Couple""-ish, war of the classes, should be light and fun, with leads who can bounce off one another with witty, even romantic, dialogue, for what else can a film whose plot involves two disparate people stranded, really be? Honestly, I don't think anyone involved knew exactly the tone they were trying for; it succeeds neither as comedy (I defy you to laugh even once) or romance (Madonna's ice-princess routine precludes ANY chemistry). It's not even bad enough for us bad-movie lovers to enjoy. A real shame...",negative,en

"Okay, I'm officially hooked. The Granite Lake Wolves actually had me at the end of Wolf Signs, but this book just reinforced my opinion.I liked Tad when he was introduced in the first book, but we really only got a quick glimpse of him. Readers found out he was a loving, over protective older brother, but that's pretty much all we got. Tad was oh so much more than that.Missy was desperate, but knew more about wolves and how things worked within packs than Tad. She felt the connection between her and Tad, but she was blinded at first by the need to escape and protect her sister. She didn't intend to find her true mate, but having it be the person she had always felt most comfortable with was perfect.Tad's sense of honor was both admirable and frustrating. He was adorable in his shyness and I loved the way he was with the rest of the pack and his sister. The relationships between all of them just keep growing stronger and I felt just as strong a connection with Robyn and Keil as I did in Wolf Signs. I like it when a series moves on, yet doesn't abandon previous characters entirely.The next book in the series is Wolf Games and it features Erik. The family connections haven't ended yet, because the female in this one is Missy's sister, Maggie. After that, we finally get to spend some quality time with TJ... that's one that I can't wait for. *sigh* Between Books 2 and 3, Vivian Arend has treated us to two novellas that are super short, but super hot. They're only 10 pages each, so I probably won't review them separately. First Howl features Robyn and Keil and Second Howl features Tad and Missy. They are worth a download though because what they lack in length, they more than make up for in heat. Just don't read them before you finish Wolf Flight.",positive,en

1.交通非常方便，海烟酒店走5分钟就是大连路地铁站。非常满意！ ：） 打车去虹桥机场基本60左右就够（当然你也可以地铁＋打的）。去浦东，建议地铁到龙阳路（4元吧），然后打的过去。又便宜，又不堵车。2.周围环境没什么突出的，都是住宅，小便利店有。3.房间还算宽敞，比较整洁，赠送饮料和上网（需要给前台电话开通）。从房间可以看到部分陆家嘴的建筑。以为离外滩很近，步行去外滩结果花了1个多小时，关键好多地方在施工，根本过不去。打车回来，只要15元左右就到了。4.早餐20元，但是自助餐的种类比较少。去的晚了的话，吃的东西不多，补餐不及时。关键还是样式少。中午和晚上正餐的花样不多，价格稍稍贵了些。5.工作人员蛮热情，继续努力！：）总体性价比还是非常高的一家酒店。强烈推荐！补充点评 2008年6月26日 ： 最近还要去上海，还准备入住。不知道是不是回头客有优惠啊？！ ：）,positive,zh

"William Shakespeare would be very proud of this particular version of his play. Not only is it the best movie version of it, but it's also the only complete version of Hamlet. Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet is simply genius. Not only because it was written by Shakespeare, but also because it had the guts to do the whole thing, even if it went just over four hours.We all know the story of the Prince of Denmark and his plot to avenge his father's death, so I won't go into the details of the story. I will, however, tell you that the best part of this Hamlet version is not the breathtaking sets or the stunning photography, but the actors' interpretations of each character. I doubt you'll find a better Polonius than Richard Briers' delicious portrayal. Plus, you can't go wrong with Julie Christie and Jack Lemmon. Also, Derek Jacobi, a regular among Shakespeare adaptations is magnificent as the antagonist to Hamlet.Of course, we must talk about Kenneth Branagh. He wowed audiences when he came onto the scene with his first outing with Shakespeare, Henry V. He outdoes himself with Hamlet. Sure, Olivier's presence was captivating, but I think Branagh's performance is wonderful. When you watch him on screen, it's almost as if he knew exactly how Shakespeare wanted the role to be played. How he wasn't nominated for an Oscar is a total mystery. At least the movie got a few nominations and even an odd choice for Screenplay. I guess they know good writing when they see it though. All in all, you'll never find a more rich and lavish production of the Bard's best play. To say that the technical aspects were awesome would be an understatement. If you love this play and are a fan of Shakespeare, you definitely need to check this movie out. Even if you don't really care for Shakespeare, the visuals will keep you occupied for the duration of the film. You may not think you'll be able to sit through all of it at once, but you'll soon find out that pausing this movie will make you want to see it even more.",positive,en

"Great location on Central Park adjacent to Russian Tea Room. Easy access to Subway, taxis, 5th Ave, Park Ave, Fashion Ave, and a Duane Reade on the corner.
Rooms are spacious for NYC standards. This hotel makes great use of under the bed drawer storage. Another pro is the luxury toiletries - Peter Thomas Roth. Rooms were clean, with no signs of bed bugs, spacious bathroom, and a safe large enough for an 11-inch laptop (and probably also a 13-inch...there was extra room). The mini-muffins and scones in the lobby for breakfast are great to pop in your mouth before you start your NYC adventure. Wi-fi was included with my hotel rate and it was fast and functioning (not always the case in hotels!). iPod/iPhone docking station by the bed as well.
Cons: It tends to function mostly as a time share property so sales pitches are common. In addition, there are no studio rooms with balconies. And, FYI, a Studio Plus room is the same as a Studio room. Hmmmph. No restaurant which means no room service available.",positive,en

"Went to this hotel twice early this year. It was under construction and the hotel prices were great. The first time was in March and we chose a room with a king size bed for around 80 a night. The room was a bit cramped (an oversized chair was in the room and blocked one side of the bed) but it was in a great location. You can walk a few blocks to the El and the 151 bus is right there for you on Michigan to take you north.
The second time we came was in early April. For about $20 more ($100) we chose a 2 room suit with fridge and microwave. We stayed 2 nights. There was one issue that was never taken care of for us though we asked repeatedly to have it resolved. There was no lamps in the living room. The only light we had was from the hallway, TV (which I hate to have on), and the light above the microwave and fridge. They would say they would send someone up with a lamp but it never happened.
I will be coming to the city soon but I feel that their prices have gone up since my last stay and unfortunately I will have to find another place to go. Though there were hiccups at this location..we had a great time otherwise. Clean rooms, nice bathrooms, comfy beds, great sheets.

"Kitch is not dead! Just Heroes date de 1989 et son véritable défaut est d'avoir très mal vieilli. Il est difficile de prendre au sérieux cette histoire familiale de triade tant la bande originale semble en décalage avec les événements qu'elle accompagne. On retrouve les ingrédients qui ont rendu John Woo célèbre avec des scènes de fusillades où les pistolets sont utilisés comme des armes blanches, où les personnages sont montrés bien au delà de leur simple rôle de gangsters mais, l'ensemble reste malgré tout très inégal. Les doublages sont mauvais et rendent les acteurs très peu convaincants. Le scénario tient la route mais il est desservi par une mise en scène qui elle aussi n'a pas été épargnée par les années. Just Heroes était surement un bon film lors de sa sortie mais il faudrait un sacré recul pour s'en apercevoir de nos jours.",negative,fr

"I wasn't sure what to expect from the Hotel Indigo, but had heard positive comments and saw very positive reviews online. The Houston location is a little hidden in that you wouldn't see it if you were not REALLY looking for it. It is sort of hidden from the street surrounded by condos and Staybridge Suites to the south, Embassy Suites to the west, a Church and parking lot to the north and the Galleria mall to the east. It is a nice property with a unique charm. All in all the staff was extremely nice and helpful and the property is clean and cheery. The decor is very nautical and slightly unusual. The lobby has oversized (really oversized) adirondack chairs and the colors and decor are of a beach retreat. They have an explanation in the rooms of their philosophy and why the nautilus shells, etc. Felt like staying in a guest suite in someone's beach house.
My only negative comment is that the pillows were not particularly comfortable. I know that may seem small, but there were basically two kinds of pillows on the bed and I didn't find either of them to suit me (one was lumpy and the other was to spongy/springy for my tastes). The bedding otherwise, however, was very comfortable and seemed to be a good quality. The bedroom itself is a little snug, but there was a generous hallway with a wet bar that was convenient and left plenty of room for belongings.
Would definitely stay there again (but maybe bring my own pillow next time).",positive,en

"I've been here twice now. First time, we didn't have very many problems, we were seated quickly but the waiter messed up on our drinks. My husband asked for an iced tea, he was served an iced coffee, he let it slide and we swapped drinks. \n\nThe second time we visited, we had children in tow, there was a 20 minute wait time which isn't that bad so we waited. After almost 30 minutes passed, I went up and asked when we would be seated, the hostess said another 20 minutes, at that point I was annoyed and asked her why it would be another 20 minutes on top of the almost 30 we had already been waiting. The manager noticed my annoyance and proceeded to seat us himself. \n\nOur waiter was very nice but we could tell right away that he was new and nervous, he was all over the place. He mixed up the orders and brought out someone else's food to our table, only checked on us once, completely blew off the parents sitting at the table next to us, and proceeded to clear up another parents table while they took their children to the bathroom (they weren't even half done with their meal) he assumed they had left. Our section was filled with disgruntled customers. We didn't hold it too much against him though since we knew he was new, but the customer service should have been better. Hopefully next time we get lucky with better service.",negative,en

The rooms were a nice size with a comfortable bed and a large bathroom where you had a choice of the shower stall or tub. Surprisingly, vey little noise from the airport. We hosted a cocktail party for customers, and everything went off without a hitch. Food and drinks were all excellent and well presented.

The night I checked in, I watied quite some time for the girl at the front counter to show up to check me in, and when she did finally show, she sobbed the entire time. I inquired if she was OK, and she insisted that she was, and she kept apologizing. The following morning, I inquired about a guest laundry, and the new girl at the front desk to me that they had one, but all of the machines were out of order. I asked if there was a local laundromat (since I was on foot for this trip) and was told that there wasn't one. I figured that I would be sneaking in to the guest laundry at another nearby hotel. Luckily, I asked another hotel staff person that same evening, and was told that the guest laundry was fine. It was! I had no problem with it at all. FInally, the ""Bright Side"" breakfast was kind of pathetic. It was always out food, and the staff seemed bothered if you asked them to restock it.",negative,en
"As intentional we visited this cafe due to many good reviews, I would say that it has good food. However, Staff customer service experience wasn’t up to standard. I sat at the corner of the sofa bench chairs and since the table and bench was narrow, there was an obstruction and sharp corner of the bench, I knock myself at the knee and it was so painful. The staff just look at me with the poker face, no asking of how am I, he simply stand there like a stone, (owner, you can see from the cctv on 2 July 3pm onwards), then I wanted to go up to view the layout of the cafe, the staff said we can go, after viewing we came down, was shock that another customer took our seats and table, wow! I was pretty shock the staff didn’t reserve the table for us, we simply went up for less than 5 mins and came down with our seats taken by another customer ?The staffs also didn’t greet us when we enter.",neutral,en

"Any film in the early days of Orson Welles is a triumph all the way to The third Man with Joseph Cotton. He is also wonderful in a Touch Of Evil. Please see them all! He tends to get pompous and self serving in films like F is for Fake, really stupid waste of film.Don't waste your time watching it. it is really ignorant. Orson Welles is a film icon and anyone studying film should see everything he has filmed. All his leading ladies are tremendous but in the end Welles became a fat drunk, like his character in A Touch Of Evil! For some reason Orson Welles had a way with women, I see how he could be considered attractive in his youth, not like Gary Cooper or Joseph Cotton, or Cary Grant,John Wayne, I could go on and on but I digress... and because I am a woman,I can see the attraction to him. He (Orson Welles) is one of the last true film makers and unless you count the film-makers of today: Tarantino, Scorscese, Spike Lee, most of the film makers just don't measure up to the film makers of the Forties! I know there are many more great film makers of today but in such a short amount of time I can't name them all. No Offense to any of the great film makers of this millennium! August 21,2006. Please remind me of some current up and coming film makers, I don't want to be stuck in the past! I love some of the films out now, but rarely are there any that I would put on a ""100 best"" list.. ""Hustle and Flow"" was great, so was ""Fargo"", and ""Oh, Brother, where art thou,"" from a line in Sullivan's travels; another fine film from the forties! Can anyone give me a best list for the 90's and on up to 2006? I would like to know who to watch! Thank you! Also Props to this website! Where else can you plug a film or boo it! i love the ranting and raving from regular folks like me who can say what I want and I promise not to spoil any film for someone who hasn't seen it yet!",positive,en
"What makes The Birthday Suit unique is that THEY CARE. I have been to countless salons where you are just a number or they look at your ticket see your name and pretend they remember you. Stacy will always remember you and it makes going to your next visit like visiting a friend not just going to another appointment. \n\nWhere do I start, have to say the customer service. I have seen Stacy every time and she is simply amazing. She is so friendly and makes you feel so comfortable (when you would think being 1/2 naked on a table baring all you wouldn't be). I have been waxing for years back in my home town but the wax that is use here much better and less painful. Stacy takes pride in her work and does such a great job even with my stubborn leg hairs, I am a challenge and she wins every time! Knowing you can go back if you ever need a touch up is great, but I have yet needed to go back. \n\nThe children's room is such a great idea for those moms just wanting to keep up with waxing without the expense of a sitter, A+ for that idea. They have great products from the body scrub (that I use daily) to the lotion that actually moisturizes and all great prices and there is always a deal going on you can catch for a discount. \n\nPrices are very reasonable and no excuse to not afford it because they have countless deals and promotions, check them out on FaceBook or just call for deals. \n\nThis Yelper Highly Recommends The Birthday Suit",positive,en

"Been out to Joe's Farm Grill twice.. and both times Ive been SO excited about going there and both times I have left well, disappointed. \n\nThis place is another restaurant from the Joe's Real BBQ gang (delish). The place is actually very cool.. you can eat out under the stars if the wind is in the right direction (there are horses close by) and they have a machine that dispenses as much ranch dressing as you can use! Gotta love that! But the food has been underwhelming and on the verge of boring. Ive tried the burgers, grilled pizzas and salads. For me they are not much better then what you could get at your local mall food court. I know it's crazy for me to say that but considering that much of what they serve is organic I just dont feel or taste a difference here. \n\nThe saving grace here is the coffee shop next door called, you got it.. Coffee Shop. They have lot of YUM-E desserts and make a some great coffee drinks. Oh get this, they hand pack there espresso machine.. no click click turbo-spresso machines here. I like the way that sounds.. I think I will steal that from myself! \n\nSide note.. this place is in the middle of nowhere becoming somewhere.. bring a map!",negative,en

"This hotel styles itself as ""InterContinental"", perhaps recognising that many of their visitors are arriving after long flights. What one chiefly needs after such a trip is a shower, perhaps some food and then a quiet restful room to crash in.
The InterContinental provides all of these things except the last. On my most recent trip, I arrived at the hotel around 9.30pm. As I checked in at the front desk, I could hear a band playing loudly. I asked the receptionist if I could be put in a room that was as quiet as possible. She obliged, putting me on the 28th floor but added that ""some guests still find it a bit noisy even up there"". I didn't think much of this since I figured not much noise could make it up 28 floors.
Unfortunately, I figured wrong. Even 28 floors up, it was like being back in a college dormitory with a party going on next door. To make things worse, the band was playing terrible covers.
This went on until sometime well after 11pm. Now that may not sound very late, but when you're coming from another time zone, all you want to do is relax and sleep, not sit up listening to muffled covers of old pop songs.
By the way, I arrived on a Thursday night, so you can't even avoid this issue by arriving during the week.
I won't be staying here again. This hotel needs to decide if it is a music venue or a place for weary travellers.",positive,en

Выписали но-шпу,эспумизан. По ренгену сказали всё хорошо. Анализы вообще пришлось узнавать по телефону. В итоге собачке становилось хуже. Ужасные боли,от которых он просто падал и орал.

"Фирма с большим наличием магнитол в зале. Самый большой минус это найти туда вход ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ что бы войти нужно обойти здание войти в подъезд 2 поднятся на второй этаж после лестницы налево, и пройдя по длинному залу найти офис 249. Почти всё магнитолы которые продают есть на стендах. ( можно опробовать) . Ту что выбрали приносят в течении 3 минут ( при мне принесли 2 клиентам) . По первой просьбк и без напоминаний достают подключают к стенду и позволяют проверить весь функционал( поиск сетей wifi, читает ли с флешек необходимые файлы и даже звук - не на самой большой громкости но уже приятно) . По поводу магнитол объясняют . Предупреждают что если какие будут проблемы с установкой можно позвонить и проконсультироваться. Гарантия 1 год от магазина на часть магнитол гарантия от Новосибирска о чём сразу и без утайки предупреждают. Да это интернет магазин с хорошим сайтом.магазин небольшой но то что можно всё проверить, оценить и сравнить огромное СПАСИБО! Рамку переходную и подключение к штатной проводке подбирают индивидуально. Главное чтоб не испортились. Отношение после посещения сугубо положительные.\nПоправка отзыва от декабря 2022 года тк купил ещё одну магнитолу но с ней вышло всё намного хуже чем с первой. \nЗаказал ещё одну магнитолу приехал забрал вся комплектация полная но в этот раз попытались кое в чем обмануть. На сайте написано что рамка идёт и под машины с климатом и под машины с кондиционером при этом прям при мне пытались вытащить рамку под кондиционер ( на сайте полная комплектация) со словами а зачем вам у вас же климат. То что у меня 2 машины и одна с климатом а вторая с кондиционером их не касается и рамку пришлось под кондиционер дорабатывать гравюром тк штатные крутилки не вставали в посадочные места. \nКупил все-таки магнитолу в полной комплектации как на сайте и приступил к установке. Да всё встало разъём в разъём но магнитола не корректно работает с Кан шиной. Открыл инструкцию и читаю для настройки Кан нужно войти в сервисное меню магнитолы и выбрать настройки своей машины. Попытка войти в сервисное меню не увенчалась успехом тк прилагаемые код к магнитоле не позволил войти в сервисное меню. Найденные кода в сети так же не помогли. Без согласования с Кан шиной не работала штатная камера заднего вида на Тойоте, и постоянно вылезала ошибка открыты передние двери но двери были закрыты. Поняв что сделать ничего не могу и время уже 9 вечера решил снять магнитолу и вернуть штатную а эту сдать в магазин. Приехав на следующий день в магазин и объяснив что не смог подключить к Кан от не машины мне сказала что установщик который ставил криворукий и нужно читать инструкцию. Подключив магнитолц на свой стенд они попытались войти в сервисное меню. Когда не получилось они открыли инструкцию и воспользовались кодом из инструкции что тоже не увенчались успехом. Начав звонить кому то после 3 минут минут разговора выяснили по модели код сервисного меню смогли войти наконец в настройки и сказали ещё раз что настройщик криворукий ( сами при этом без звонка другу не смогли сделать ничего) сказали что магнитолу никто не настраивал. И вообще типа для этого есть сервис центр( в который я звонил но было 9 вечера и никто не ответил) который мне бы помог. Вернул магнитолу и получил назад деньги да продавцы были недовольны но тк платил налом отдали всё сразу. \nКогда товарищ купил у них же магнитолу тоже не смог войти в сервисное меню я связался через вотсап с тех поддержкой мне сказали что я магниттлу такую у них не покупал а точнее купил и сдал и сервис мне оказан не будет (хотя с за полгода до этого брал себе магнитолу которая слава богу работает нормально и обращаться по ней не требуется) вдруг я из пазы покупателей пропал. Очень интересно как так? \nВторую магниттлу с товарищем настроили Найдя код сервисного меню в интернете ( благо взяли распространую модель) и сами вск настроили. Кстати у товарища также пытались вытащить часть рамки под кондиционер намекая у Вас же климат - наверное это такой прикол и потому я когда покупал не посмотрел на комплектность рамки переходной. \n К сожалению одна и та же контора а какие разные впечатления. За вторую покупку хочу поставить 2 звезды но тк большой ассортимент оставляю 4 . Приучите пожалуйста персонал не разукомплектовывать товар даже если не нужна часть рамки зачем вынимать? И пусть в инструкции перед покупкой проверяют сервисный код. Тех поддержка пусть лучше проверяет базу а то купив магнитолу я оказываюсь в базе на поддержку а купив вторую пропадает информация о первой покупке и я оказываюсь без поддержки.",positive,ru

"We had a free night from the stay 3 and get one free BW promotion, so we decided to spend a couple of days in downtown Seattle, we live in Kent, a suburb.

That evening after a full day in the city we came back to Pioneer Square, I purchased a bottle of wine in a store just around the corner. When we got back to the hotel I asked if they had a corkscrew to open the wine. The clerk gave me one to keep and asked if we would like wine glasses also.

The same hairs were on the floor in the bathroom when we left as when we got there despite a note with a tip to the housekeeper to clean it up-she took the note and the cash, so I know she got the message. We also had room service the first night and the dishes were still on the table when we left 2 days later. Decided to downgrade if that was an upgrade. Now in a single room that is like being in a bomb shelter. Concrete block with only a door for light-no windows and definitely no view. Left a note for the housekeeper to clean up the broken glass and she just crumpled it up and left it on the night stand. I come to San Diego almost every year to see my friends and we are going back to the Mistral in Coronado next year. Sorry Dave. Hope you find a new job soon.",negative,en

"The hotel is very attractive, even more attractive than the website photos make it seem. The location is fantastic-directly on the beach-prime people watching location. It is definitely one of the nicer hotels in the area-some of it's neighbors are downright seedy. We were room upgraded without asking. The room was super comfortable with an ocean view, and doors out to the rooftop deck (lounge chairs, mini water fall, fire pit). We don't usually indulge in the mini bar, but they had such unusual drinks that we couldn't help ourselves! I highly recommend trying the Peels Blueberry Pomegranate...
We ate at the hotel restaurant-which faces the beach. We were there for sunset, which was such a nice touch. The food was really delicious and unique. It is not inexpensive, so be prepared-this is not burgers on the beach.
My one complaint is that the ""valet"" experience was not fantastic. Specifically, I think it's pretty ridiculous to charge $20.00 for parking on top of a $249.00 room rate. I'm assuming that parking is at a premium on the beach, but I still think it's in poor form to charge that much.
That being said, we would definitely stay here again, and highly recommend it to others.",positive,en

"We stayed at Hampton Inn Times Sq. North on 8th Avenue near 50th Street for 4 nights; June 8-June13. Don't hesitate choosing this hotel (tips we learned about nyc at end of review). We've stayed in big cities before such as Paris, so I knew what I wanted before we went. First, the subway entrance is across the street which means a lot less walking just to get to your destination. The area is safe and kept up well. The hotel is clean and well managed. The staff was always very helpful...if concierge was busy, we asked a dif. employee for i.e. directions and they were always helpful & correct. Breakfast was sufficient...get down there before 7:30 a.m. Our last day there, my daughter and I slept in and my husband went down and got us some breakfast. He went back down at 8:30 for something and he said it was packed and the breakfast food wasn't all replenished. We went to bkfst between 6:30 and 7:00 the other days and it was quiet and all the food was out. Nothing to brag about, but it gave us something decient to eat before heading out for the day. There was always something hot such as a cheese omelete (okay) & i.e. bacon or sausage. One morning they had western omelete and hashbrowns. Always a variety of bagels, pastries, muffins, a fruit mix, fresh fruit i.e. bananas, apples, juices, cold cereal, & coffee. I read the reviews before I reserved it and the apples are good (someone wrote they are mushy), so get some extra. Also, there are breakfast bags at the front desk (you've got to get these before 7:00 or they're gone) for people on the run. We got a few for our train ride back. We reserved a two queen bedded room and we got it(checked in after 5:00 p.m.) The room was clean (not spotless, but close) and the beds were comfortable. The pillows were average. I would definitely stay here again. As were were leaving, they were offering a two night stay starting at 299 (no taxes included). We paid $1666 for 4 nights which included all taxes(there's a lot of nyc taxes). We were in a hurry so we didn't have time to really think about it so we decllined. If we didn't want to visit some other places, I think it was a great deal. we'd love to go back and we definitely would stay at their hotel. Some tips: If you are going to use the subway and buses get a daily fun pass or 7 day metro card. We got the 7 day care which saved us a lot of money (we didn't have to decide, should we take the bus or subway and pay 2.25 each or walk a lot further). A lot of the subway runs north and south. North is uptown (this is how it is defined at the subway); South is downtown...that's used for the directions. In example, if you are leaving Penn Station and going to this hotel, you would use line E uptown. There are some subway lines that go into i.e. Queens or Brooklyn and it will say this as the direction...just figure which direction you are going and asked someone who doesn't look like a tourist. I usually asked people ages mid 20's to late 30's and they were very helpful. I have to say, NEW YORKERS ARE FRIENDLY AND HELPFUL. When we arrived from Penn Station and took the E line and my husband was carrying the luggage (one at a time) up the stairs, people offered to help us and we were glad to get the help : ) When we asked someone about how to get somewhere, most people were glad to help (we only ran into i.e. a couple of people who ignored us...maybe they were tourist from a dif. country??) We bought the New York Pass (not the city pass) which included more places. We used our whole day and part of the evening visiting many places. I checked what times they were open and the days (i.e. Met. Mus of Art open till 9:00 on Fri.) and put the places were wanted to see the most first and the others at the bottom. Without the pass it would have cost us more. Food in nyc is not that expensive. We live in OH and it was much more than what we pay here, but we didn't go to any fancy restaurants. Caruso's pizza place by Fulton and Broadway was really good and inexpensive. There are Chipotle (the one across from our hotel gave my daughter and I bathroom problems-we had the chicken burrito). But everything else there was reasonable. Check out American Eagle at times sq. They have a deal: if you purchase something, you get your pic on the jumbotron...it's really something (she also has A.E. times sq. top and others that you can't purchase anywhere else...that is cool for a 15 year old : ). I think that was the best part of her trip even though she loved everything else. Before we left I borrowed from the library & read NYC for dummies and Eyewitness Travel NYC and Eyewitness Travel top 10 NYC. I also borrowed a travel nyc dvd. They are all good books to read. They eyewitness ones have a lot of pics (the top 10 doesn't have as many pics, but you can look them up on the internet). We also took Amtrak to nyc out of Clev. After see the traffic there, we definitely would not drive and are glad that we didn't have to. We used the subway as late as 1:30 a.m. and no problems- There is an S subway train that goes into Times Square...Take it! Or at least just visit the subway area...bands playing...a man dressed as spider man and playing a saxophone, etc...too much fun to miss. Some free sights are Highline Park which is beautiful; Central Park; Metropolitan Museum of Art (they ask i.e. $10 suggested adult donation, but you don't have to give that much...this was included in our NYC Pass...to a free place??? Anyways, St. John Cathedral Divine on Amsterdam (there wasn't a charge when we went although it said there was on the internet and it was included in our NYC Pass). Other beautiful Churches such as St. Patricks by Rockefeller; walks in Little Italy Area & Chinatown---The one nice thing about having the nyc pass was that if it was included and we wanted to see it, we didn't feel like we had to stay at the place along time to get our money's worth (like at the Guggenheim...went there to walk along the hallways, but they were closed getting ready for a new exhibit...exhibits not much to look at...just wanted to see the building. Metropolitan mus., American museum of natural history; MOMA are terrific museums. I recommend getting either this pass or the city pass and mix it in with free places for an eclectic vacation.

Put a sign at the door to at least forewarn people of what they'll need to expect and tolerate. When we spoke to our wait staff about this they said they received complaints everyday and that it was really embarrassing....it's not cute or endearing Mario - grow up and don't be so indulgent.

"Let me say I have given the Hyatt Regency Century City a fair chance. I have stayed on three separate occasions over the last year, each a minimum of three nights. The location is convenient, the rooms are very nice, the pool and bar look great. Let me also say that I am a frequent guest at the Kimpton Palomar and the Intercontinental Century City so I know the competition. Each time at the Hyatt there have been frustrations, but the last visit was the last straw. On Sunday midnight 10/31 they had a planned electric power shutdown at the hotel from until 4 am. Yes, I said planned, not accidental. The only notification I received was a note in my room when I arrived back at 11:30 pm. No notice at booking. No notice at check in. No notice the day before. So after an extremely stressful meeting, I could not watch TV, read a book, use my laptop, or take a shower. The Hyatt provided a chemical glow stick for light. Seriously, camping at the Hyatt Regency? Yes, I did complain in person at the front desk. Even though I am a Hyatt Gold member, because I had booked through Travelocity, the front desk could not refund my room so I could move to another hotel. Yes, they did offer me free valet parking in compensation. Sorry, but that did not help me relax so I could get some sleep. The letter said they only do this once a year (lucky me) but the true issue is the management's attitude. This attitude applies to many other issues at the Hyatt, If you stay during the week, and are not part of a convention, you will find the lobby packed, a ridiculously long wait to check in, and an impossible line at Starbucks. The valet parking is incredibly congested and has not improved over a year's time. It can take 10 minutes waiting to drop off your car and over 15 minutes for them to retrieve it. And for this they charge $36 a day! Yes, I have parked in the self-park lot. This is a long outdoor walk in the dark around the corner and up/down stairs to reach the hotel entrance. Not comfortable for women who are alone. Management needs to stop resting on reputation of the hotel from 20 - 30 years ago and start addressing the current problems. I'll stick with the Palomar from now on - excellent and personal service, free wireless, wine hour each evening.",negative,en

"I don't know if bad customer service is a result of being one of the new hotels on the strip, but it is certainly bad at Aria.\n\nThe front desk doesn't have one big line, it is on a first come, first served basis. I went to one of the shorter lines thinking that I scored. NOT! Apparently the couple ahead of me were having an issue with their room which took some time. I stood in line for 30 minutes (all the while seeing people who came 15 minutes after me check in before me!). \n\nFinally after getting up to the counter, the rep doesn't apologize for the wait, despite seeing me stand there for 30 minutes with no acknowledgment.\n\nWe get up to the room and it's really big! Relieved that I'm finally in my room, I start taking a look at all the amenities inside. There is an Audio/Video panel that has all kinds of ports: USB, S-Video, internet, etc. There is even an iPod/iPhone input...awesome! So I get out my cable to play some music, and then I realize that the input isn't compatible with the iPod USB cable. So I look through the manuals on the table to see if I'm missing something and it doen't say.\n\nSo I call the front desk to ask, and the girl said she doesn't know and transferred me to their IT line. The person answers and we have a very uncomfortable exchange until he realizes that I'm a guest and not an employee. At this point he said that they only assist staff and not guest issues...so I have to call the front desk again. Ugh......\n\nSo I call, again, and I reach another person. He said that in order to use the iPod connectivity in the panel, you have to go to the gift shop and buy a proprietary cable for $15. Are you serious?! I really hope that they haven't made anything off their little scam; I can't understand how they can expect anyone to buy a cable that will probably only work at their hotel. At the Palms they have an iPod dock that comes with the room, for free! Needless to say, I was totally annoyed.\n\nOn the bright side, their housekeeping staff is very friendly and responsive; the rooms are really big and SUPER comfortable; we had an excellent view of the Marquee as well. \n\nFor the price, the room itself is great and the hotel is very clean and upscale. But the service leaves something to be desired for sure.\n\nI'm not going to write off the Aria just yet, but hopefully they don't keep this up for too long.",negative,en

"If you do not want to party, please avoid this hotel. At weekends it is a must for the locals who want to party all night long. The sky bar on the roof (with nice views) is filled with people who want to be seen. Rooms (with the description fabulous) are small and not very practical. Where to hang all your clothes or where to put all your things in the bathroom? Design has taken too much from the convenience and practicalities. The service varies a lot, both at the reception as well as in the breakfast room. The hotel is absolutely too pricy and not worth 4 stars!",negative,en

"From the time we walked in the door it was nothing but horrendous. I have stayed at 4 diamond resorts before and this place doesnt deserve its ratings at all. They first gave us a hard time about bringing in our cooler. After taking it back to our car and finally getting to our room, we noticed that there was still garbage in the garbage can, the carpet was stained and dirty, the windows had smudge marks all over them, and our toilet had blood on it! Needless to say we were disgusted and would have left but we were meeting friends for the weekend. I ended up asking the housekeeping person in the hallway for some cleaning supplies so I could clean it myself because I didnt trust them moving us to another room. We ordered room service with just a simple fruit plate and it took an hour for them to bring it up. The hotel doesnt even have a pool and the staff are not very customer service oriented. When we checked out we notice they charged us for something in the mini bar because we picked something up out of it and put it back. There are sensors on the mini bar so make sure not to touch anything or you'll be charged for it. All in all, I felt like they tried to nickel and dime us for everything in the hotel. This is fine for a nice hotel, but this place has detroit scam written all over it. The casino is full of trash as well, including the people in it. Not worth the money at all, especially because of the filth. Im never going back again!",negative,en

"I have tried this place twice now and both times I left extremely disappointed. I keep hearing great things about it, but I just don't get why. \nThe counter that you have to order from is so high I couldn't even see over it, so when they're standing there just looking at me waiting for me to tell them what ingredients I wanted, I didn't have a clue what the options were! I know I'm only 5'3\"", but come on, this is ridiculous, a lot of people are my height. \nThe people making the bowl/wraps didn't even speak English well enough to answer the 97 questions that I had. So I eventually gave up asking. \nThen the sticker shock comes when my total is almost $15 for just me! \nTo top it all off, I finally sit down to a sticky table and crumb filled seat, only to look at my order for the first time (now that it's not hiding behind what feels like a 9 foot prison wall) to find what can honestly be a bowl of 50% lettuce! Seriously? I went through this stress and paid an hourly wage for a bowl of lettuce with tiny drops of who-knows-what sprinkled throughout? \nFool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me.

"I really liked the food here and it was reasonably priced and not exactly ordinary.

Only 2 double beds for 4 people which I find surprising in nicer hotels today and we could not get a rollaway for my teenager due to fire code (even though they list this as an option on their website). But the beds were comfortable which was a nice surprise. Furnishings were a little dated but clean and in good condition. Pool was warm and excercise area was nice with good equipment. There is a Starbucks onsite and the onsited Hertz rental car was great for renting a car for a day or two to explore the area. Room service was prompt and cost reasonable. Desk clerks were a little snooty and not terribly friendly or helpful. Location was easy to find and there is a small mall across the street with several very nice restaurants, a movie theater, and a Macy's. Easy to walk to with the family for dinner and shopping.

It was a Saturday evening and the restaurant was strangely rather empty - 2-3 tables occupied only. We sat outside on the balcony which was reasonably nice. Service was not easy; certainly considering the prices you'd expect significantly better. The team did not appear cohesive nor very well trained. But the food was the greatest disappointment. 'Fine dining' is not a label you can really apply here. Clearly that's the intention, but honestly it is nowhere near that standard. More of a pretentious attempt. Quality of raw materials is questionable - the steak, despite the price, was below average even for KL (and even for non-fine-dining places). And the asparagus appetiser was rather comically presented as though my 6 year old had tried to plate a dish. If fine-dining is what you want, there are plenty of other really good restaurants in KL with consistently good quality food and service. This place is best avoided unless you want to pay an arm and a leg for disappointing food and average (at best) service.",negative,en

I was at Sushi Samba for a party and they had passed apps which were great. Great sushi, great crab cakes, awesome skewers of beef...But mind you passed apps. \nThe drinks....amazing. As far as the Samba Juice. This is the only place in town I know that mixes with Acai berrys. Which give a unique chocolate hint to a blueberry flavor. Definitely high in antioxidents.\nBut I came here for brunch with a friend. \nNow I sat at the bar and we ordered drinks. She ordered the Pomelo...but they didnt't have any. So then the Cucumber. I had the Samba Juice again. I decided to order Churros because I LOVE HOME MADE CHURROS. Too bad I didn't get them. Grrr they took forever. I also ordered food to go. Feijoada, chorizo, linguisa(kinda portuguese sausage) and some peruvian corn which is like giant hominy. \nWell the order was wrong because I ordered sides and he asked me how I wanted my eggs. The bartender was really slow. I asked him some questions on why he was shaking a certain way and he said it was because they put egg whites in the drink.

"Would I eat here again? Most definitely. Would I make a special trip to eat here? No. However, that is contingent on breakfast cereal cravings, see below. (Also, I must confess a bias for Chef Simon just because I really don't care for Cat Cora, no flames please!)\n\nSo after seeing KGB featured on some food show for their waffle fry nachos my boyfriend mentioned that he would like to try them out. After passing through the smoke filled casino (has Harrah's always been that smokey or am I getting old?) we were greeted by the cutest hostess I have seen to date. I have to say I really did like the \""Russian\"" uniform with the hot pants and fishnet stockings. She seated us and asked us if we were on vacation and how we had heard of them. Kudos for pleasant demeanor. The chefs in the kitchen were also wearing green \""Russian\"" uniforms and there were provocatively dressed comic book drawings on the walls. And it is amusing to see Stoli chillin' in giant blocks of ice.\n\nBeing the little piglet I am, I had the milkshake trio. The captain crunch milkshake was the bomb! My bf had a sip and said to me, \""You have to figure out how to make that at home.\"" It was like a childhood dream come true. Memories of letting cereal get soggy, then slurping up the sweetened milk, ah, happiness. Moving on, the strawberry was very good but I kind of gave up drinking it because I couldn't get it through the straw. I mean, it IS a drink. The chunks of fresh strawberries were so big it was more like a fruit smoothie. Liquefy that sucker. Also I noticed my love for chocolate seems to be waning as I get older. The chocolate malt milkshake was good. Way chocolate. Way chocolate enough that I couldn't finish the little glass it came in. But still good. Certainly a go for lovers of the cacao bean.\n\nAs for the waffle fry nachos, I would really really really recommend this as an appetizer for a table of four. Especially if everyone plans on having an entree. The plate came out heaped a good half foot tall. The waffle fries were covered in oozing melted cheese. After attacking it from the side I managed to dig into the creamy cheese and pulled pork in the middle (yes, I deftly avoided the salsa and slices of jalapeno). So good, so rich, so taking home about three quarters of it. Our (huge) burgers arrived and we began to nosh on those as well. I had the BBQ Bacon Burger and my boyfriend had the Double Cheeseburger. My burger was good, I really liked the onion bun. I think they cooked it a little closer to medium rare then the medium I had asked for. The bacon was adequate and the fries were tasty. However, I think I will stick to Five Guys. My bf's was a perfect medium. He commented that it was good, but he would probably have liked it better if he had just built his own.\n\nI think there were only two things I was irked at the entire meal. One was all the food pretty much arrived at the same time. The app was brought then the entrees arrived like three minutes later. The second thing is wiggle room. The plates are tiny. I know that presentation goes a long way but I would like to be able to cut my burger in half and not worry about my fries falling off my plate. I think if I were to go back I would mostly likely sample things other than burgers on their menu. Things like fried mac and cheese . . .",negative,en

"This flight went surprisingly well. I was expecting a typical budget airline experience, filled with negatives to occur. The flight left within 15 minutes of departure, which is considered on time in the industry. We arrived on time in CLE. Contrary to recent news reports, the gate agents were not enforcing bag size/weight check at the gate when my mom and I were boarding the plane. Frontier got new seats and these a lot comfier and better than the old seats, now with a better sized tray table! It’s nice to have a direct flight to CLE from SAN for us. Far better and calmer experience than LAX. It was a great July 4 experience! Great deal too, the airfare itself excluding extras was $59, though those did add up quickly, but we know that when choosing an ULCC. Ex: Carry on was $65, seats $28/per person. Beware though , they charge $1 more for the middle seat! Why? Also not all planes have the new seating yet, but hopefully it’s coming soon. That’s why it’s not 10/10.",positive,en

Basierend auf einer wahren Geschichte, getragen von einem herausragenden Cast!

Die Handlung wechselt von düsteren Szenerien zu fast schon idyllischen Landschaftsaufnahmen, bewirkt dadurch einen fesselnden Spannungsbogen, der trotzdem den Charakteren Zeit lässt, sich zu entfalten. Die unterschiedlichen Stimmungen, die die drei Brüder durchleben, wird dem Zuschauer sehr gut rüber gebracht.

"The food alone is worth five stars, but there were a few detractors in our experience that made me knock off a star. Let's review.\n\nThe space itself is really nice, although small, with gorgeous wallpaper, red lacquered tables and little stone 'pillows' for your spoons and chopsticks. It's that sort of attention to detail that I appreciate. The service was good as well, the servers were all kind and courteous. The menu is fairly extensive, with something for everyone's tastes, and a good number of traditional Korean dishes and loads of seafood. Nom.\n\nWe ordered the pork and squid bulgogi and hot pot with tofu and clams. The flavors were incredible, especially the bulgogi - tender pork, even more tender squid, cooked to spicy perfection. We cleaned that place instantaneously. The hot pot was quite good as well, although there was an abundance of onions and only five lonely clams in the whole bowl. They were so good, I wanted more of them! This is part of the reason why Shilla falls short of a five-star experience. The other reason was the banchan - I'm likely spoiled, but I'm used to plentiful, bottomless banchan and at Shilla we only received four dishes (and kimchi wasn't even included! sacrilege!) and once they were empty, they were gone. \n\nAfter we were done eating and our dishes were cleared and we mentioned that we were all finished now, thank you very much, we were made to wait for a good ten-fifteen minutes while the servers cleared tables and sat new arrivals. We finally had to ask for the check specifically. Am I missing something, or is it customary to marinate once one is finished with one's meal and sitting at an empty table?\n\nI think once my expectations have been lowered a bit, I could definitely enjoy Shilla for the great Korean food and amazing flavors - but don't expect plentiful portions or an abundance of banchan.",neutral,en

The Frank Lloyd Wright inspired architecture is worth a visit on its own, and the grounds are well maintained and pleasant to the eye. The conference facilities are on a par with most other resorts, and their fine dining restaurant, Wright's at the Biltmore, is excellent. The accomodations, however, are due a makeover. The furniture in our room was outdated and worn, the carpeting has reached its limit,

Plus, they feel historic, like apartments from the early 19th century, mine had three closets- two of which looked like they were something else at one point. The check in staff was pleasant. But the pool staff was horrible. I sat there for 2 hours without anyone coming up to ask if I wanted anything. Quite honestly I got the feeling I wasn't cool enough, compared to the ironic mullets that were lounging by and ashing in the pool; cool kids who I felt pretty confident were not guests.

"One of the few pub grub joints in town with character.

Clam chowder and Onion au gratin soup are solid plays at $4 per cup. Great apps are the mountain of Clam strips for $6 or Cod fish and chips for $10, which are perfect when you're craving something fried to go with your brew.

"We stayed for 5 nights and really enjoyed our stay. The GM, Jonathon is a credit to his hotel and the Marriott chain - nothing was too hard. His staff are top notch and are to be commended. The suites are a good size, although our bedroom was a little smaller than some of the other hotels we've stayed at. Our room was a bit hot, but that's my fault for not reporting the A/C at the time. The room was spotless and included a decent kitchen area, sofa etc. The hotel offers a free local area shuttle which will get you to the zoo, downtown (Gaslamp) and old town which really saved our already sore feet!
My only complaints are based on comparison with other hotels that we'd just stayed at; The breakfast selection wasn't huge, adequate but not as expansive as some of the others we'd experienced. The manager's function which we joined one night only happens a few times a week and is very basic, but at least they have one! - again just not like say an Embassy function.
I have no problems recommending this hotel, its location, cleanliness, brilliant staff, free shuttle, free breakfast and oh a great pool make it a great choice for anyone looking for somewhere to stay in San Diego.",positive,en

"I paid $80 for this 4 star hotel through <url> I looked on the website and it was $207 a regular night. Holy cheeto balls! That's outrageous. $80 is priced correctly for this hotel. Not worth $200 at all. I'd probably bump it down to a 31/2 star hotel not 4. Overall, not a horrible hotel. I probably won't stay here again just because I like to try different hotels everywhere I go. However, if you purchased a priceline deal and got this hotel, this is what you get.
+ Requested extra towels, they were brought up immediately
+ Check in and Check out was quick and easy
+ We got a remodeled double bed room facing the city. I was content about that because I was dreading an old green carpeted room from reviews I've read.
+ Location was great. Close to Barton Springs and Whole foods market.

At least it was not just us because they seemed to treat their coworkers with the same indifference. Again, we were their for six days and hardly saw the staff interact with each other.

"This latest from TA Chase is very sexy and hot. Vol 1 centers on Kasey a famed but closeted basketball star, who finds love with a much older nightclub owner.The story could have been more angsy if the writer so choose asit is never easy for a gay athlete to come out as he could lose all his fans and sponsors. But TA focuses more on the erotica side, the tauntings from fellow players, reporters more a side issue. And it works as this man writes the sex scenes so well. And it is rare to have a well over 6 feet basket ball player being 100% bottom even if an agressive bottom in a relationship.

"My wife and I decided to take long weekend on the San Antonio Riverwalk for our anniversary in early November, 2012. We had heard that the Wyndham St. Anthony had been remodeled and thought we would give it a try. The lobby is fabulous. Very retro (30's-40's) with chandeliers, beautiful artwork, and very comfortable seating in the common areas. We felt we were in for a great stay for $99 per night plus fees and taxes. To our surprise the luxury ended at the lobby. Our room was supposed to have been ADA handicapped accessible. Ha! The only thing remotely close to ADA code was an oversized towel bar in the tub/shower. The doors were not wide enough for wheel-chair access. The oversized 4-post bed was so tall that my 5' 2"" wife had to literally climb in using the bed rail and I scooted in after placing my rear on the edge and backing onto the bed. The bath was extremely small (approximately 4' x 6'). The tub was old with mold in several areas both at the top and bottom. The sink was pedestal-style with a dripping faucet (reported at checkin, still not fixed when we left on the 3rd day. Storage consisted of a small glass shelf above the sink. My wife could not use the mirror even standing on her tiptoes. The television was not visible from the bed unless I removed one of the bedposts. Not only that, the television was a 90's analog TV with minimal cable access. Carpet was filthy. My white socks were black after walking around the room. Our garden view room overlooked a rooftop party area. Nothing is included in the nightly fee. Parking is $10 per day across the street (self-parking), $30 + tip for valet, or take a chance on scoring a meter on the surrounding streets. An additional fee applys to internet access as well. I assumed the daily newspaper was free because I just took one of of the checkin counter. Would I stay again? NO! Not even gratis.",negative,en

"I sincerely wonder why this film was ever made. A Bulgarian-Italian co-production set in a version of Berlin where all Germans speak English with a German accent and all Turks speak English with some Turkish words in between, is hardly credible. The English vocabulary is basically limited to ""fuck you, bastard"" and the acting is worse than anyone can imagine. Apart from this, racial tensions in Germany can be an interesting subject but in the Germany I know there are no gangs shooting each other in the middle of the street in clear daylight. And if all that is not enough, there is also a serial killer going around who kills Turkish children and paints them white. In order to create some tension, we see the serial killer and hear him hum Schubert's lullaby but we won't see his face. I don't even believe they actually shot it in Germany. There are some street shots that are quite obviously in Berlin, but the actors are not seen in those shot. It's probably Bulgaria with some German signs added here and there.",negative,en

"If you want to stop off to see the worlds largest thermometer and have some food, then this stop is for you. The Mad Greek in itself is an ok place. There are two locations; one in Baker (near Death Valley) and then one near the entrance to LV. It's usually packed so if you like Greek food, then this may be for you. From what I remember, the falalel balls were tasty and weren't overly fried. A creamy Tahini sauce accompanies most dishes which is perfect since the weather here is HOT! The restaurant designed with roman statues and columns on the outside so you can't miss it when you are exiting. The inside is more like a greek cafeteria and is congested with a lot of seating space and people to match. The Baker stop has an option for a decent bathroom and like I said before, if you look to the left of the Mad Greek, you will see a large pole showing the temperature. This is the only one found in America and although it boasts that it shows the right temperature, its actually off a couple of degrees.",negative,en

"I stayed here for one night only after reading other reviews, and after receiving a really good rate. Staff were generally friendly and helpful - special mention must be made of the doorman, who was exceptionally friendly and helpful and not the least bit condescending. The registration staff were, well, reserved and offered no help or information. The first thing I noticed on entering was the smell. The place smelled old and musty - especially in the elevators. The room seemed fine at first glance, although the sheets apparently had not been pressed or ironed and the towels were hanging skew on the rails. The worst was the bathtub, which was infested with black mold along the sides - so badly that I was reluctant even to shower. I had dinner in the hotel also. The menu seemed fine, but the food might as well have been sawdust. My steak was overcooked, even though I asked for a ""medium"" steak. The fries were very good, but the rolls were microwaved and had been in the microwave too long. Breakfast the next morning was equally nondescript and less than appealing. When I checked out, I mentioned the problems with the room, and was made to wait while the receptionist filled out forms and phoned people - so perhaps they have cleaned out the mold by now. Checkout usually takes a few seconds or minutes and is automated in most hotels. Not this one. I had to wait at least 10-15 minutes - and I was the only guest checking out. So - despite a great location, I certainly will not return to this hotel. If they allow bathrooms that are visibly affected, then I have to question overall cleanliness of everything else.",negative,en

"A less-than-subtle poke at the beliefs and teachings of the Catholic Church is given a darker shade of death near the end of the show. Throughout the show, dark humour plays a medium through which several commonly heard rhetoric questions are asked, especially ""If God is so good, why does he allow evil to exist in the world?""Diane Keaton is excellent in her role as an exaggerated version (though some might disagree) of they stereotyped religious teacher who spouts the ""company line"" and condemns half the world to burn in Hell. To celebrate her school's 25th anniversary, she invites her first students to return and perform their Christmas pageant.However, when the quartet ""update"" their play to parody Sister Mary's ""fallacious"" teachings, the nun is pushed over the edge, sending the story spiralling into a chain of unhappy events.

I tell them about this place I loved and bring home cupcakes. My grandfather comes to check out what's in my hand, the dog starts growling, I'm thinking she protective of me. I put my stuff down, take off to my room to change, come back and she's still growling at him and everyone else, a stance between her and the cupcakes.\n\nMy grandfather says, let's test the theory (he knows if you wrestle me the dog will attack) so he comes over and kicks my ass with the help of other family members. The dog holds her ground, protect the cupcakes and not the lady that feeds her.\n\nThis was absolutely a relief, I use to be afraid of someone breaking into the house in the middle of the night and I didn't know if Zoey could rise to the occasion to protect the home. But it brings me to tears to know every Sweet Daddy cupcake will be safe while the robbers are tying me to a chair and gagging me. Never a more proud moment to a pet parent.

"When I first moved to Arizona, I lived less than a mile away from this place, so as you can imagine, I've driven by it thousands of times. Seven years later, I finally made my way down the driveway to check it out, and I'm glad I did!\n\nI went to meet some friends at their pumpkin patch. Since it's unseasonably hot lately, and we all have young babies, we decided to meet first thing in the morning (at 9am, when they first open). Smart move... even then it was pretty hot outside! Luckily, MacDonald's Ranch has cold refreshments such as snoballs which we all enjoyed. (Thanks Jake B for treating!)\n\nUnfortunately though, none of us knew that the actual pumpkin patch was a hayride away, and none of us felt comfortable bringing our newborns on the hayride, even with the car seats in tow. So, we did make it to the ranch but left empty handed. I guess I'll have to purchase my pumpkin elsewhere this season. That said, MacDonad's Ranch does offer a ton of other fun activities including a petting zoo, pony rides, music, etc. They host all kinds of events too, such as birthday parties, weddings, and corporate events.\n\nOnce Baby M is a bit older, I will definitely return to MacDonald's Ranch, but I don't think I got my $8 worth (the cost of entry) this time around. Oh well... Happy Halloween all!",negative,en

"Although we live in Washington, my husband and I along with another married couple, which are close friends of ours, stayed over Valentine's weekend (February 12th - 13th 2011.) We booked a package for the Valentine's Day which included dancing and champagne at the hotel's club.
Unfortunately, the weekend was unpleasantly interrupted the morning of February 13th when an employee of the hotel used his all access room key to enter our friend's room even though they had the ""Do Not Disturb"" sign on the door and check out time was much later. The Doubletree employee walked in on them in the middle of an intimate moment and saw my best friend naked. She was appalled and mortified and both she and her husband screamed and clumsily fell off of the bed in a panic.
We roomed next door and heard the commotion, but thought it was just someone goofing on off in the hallway. We were appalled when shortly thereafter our friends told us what was going on.
When they called the management of the hotel (the highest ranking person in management on that day was the Housekeeping Supervisor), she reported that there were no male housekeepers, so they must be mistaken. Mistaken? Really?
The male friend of the couple is a Detective in the police department, and immediately kicked into ""detective mode."" He had to insist they contact hotel security and do an investigation to find out who entered their room.
Much chaos ensued along with my friend in tears and my husband and me trying to console her. I ended up speaking with the housekeeping supervisor, who added insult to injury by misstating my friend's first name to me and when I told her she was incorrect, instead of apologizing and asking for her name, had the audacity to tell me that my friend had misspoken her OWN name.
Several hours later, we finally found out that the man, which indeed WAS on Doubletree's hotel staff was a ""runner."" He entered the room unauthorized to put water bottles in it (something that is only supposed to happen in unoccupied rooms being prepped for the next guests) and completely bypassing the Do Not Disturb, the fact that the guest list was registered to check out later that day, AND breaking many other hotel protocols.
This employee of Doubletree also did NOT report the incident to his supervisor. They had to investigate the room key access for that room to find out it had been him.
There were other minor things that had occurred during the stay that one can chalk up to ""hotel anomalies."" As a frequent business traveler, I get that some minor things can happen. However, this security breach and the mishandling of the situation thereafter is absolutely inexcusable.
I left a message for the Hotel's General Manager, which as of this morning has still to return my call. I will not be staying at this Hilton Hotels Doubletree property ever again. I suggest that if you want to feel safe, that you do not either.",negative,en

"Booked the Westin Times Square on the strength of the Westin name. The hotel was nice , but impersonal. We had a double club room on the 14th floor. The room was smaller than I expected and the charge for internet was a bit much. These rooms are not exactly budget priced . We paid extra for the club room and we got the I-Mac computer - but had to pay to get online. Our biggest issue however was that our room door faced on to an inner courtyard of the hotel - which seemed to be used as a meeting place for business. So every morning of our stay at 7:00 am it was very noisy in our room -as there were at least 150 people milling about below our rooms clanging plates, cups etc... and chatting. That was annoying to say the least. We had asked for a quiet room and we dismayed to hear this chaos first thing in the morning. Also, throughout the night there was a lot of noise from nearby construction going on - New York is truly the city that never sleeps - at least it's construction crews! Again, the hotel was nice - but not really worth the price we paid. I have stayed in many hotels far superior at a much better price - Next time, we'll be at the Affinia Shelburne or Dumont, the Lucerne or the Blakely - they have the personal touches that make you feel special.

Видимо потому, что я снизила общую цену путем отказа от гарнитура магазина с накруткой в 200% (те же самые ручки на озоне в 2 раза дешевле). Не долго думая, консультанты решили компенсировать свой минус за счет повышения цен на доставке, услугам замерщика и тп. Разница казалось бы везде незначительная от 100 до 500 рублей, но общую картину производит отвратительную. На вопрос «почему у вас повышение цен происходит за неделю?» мне ответили, что «вы бы еще месяц походили и повыбирали». После такого ответа все сразу стало понятно, вежливые только тогда, когда на кону заказ. А если заказ не очень выгоден и клиент что-то выбирает сам, они компесируют это накруткой сверху.\nДАННЫЙ САЛОН НЕ РЕКОМЕНДУЮ от слова «СОВСЕМ». \nС такими «менеджерами» далеко они не уйдут)",negative,ru

Ladies if you miss that rugged manly smell from you guy, stop by and pick him up some manly soaps and beard supplies. With fragrances like whiskey, tobacco, and pine how can you go wrong. What about a bison leather flask, I totally want one of those for myself. \n\nIn talking to the owner he advised that this fun store would be closing in a couple of weeks and while he plans to relocate in the future for the time being online sales will be the only way to acquire these amazing items.

"unPhogettable\nMekong Plaza\n66 S. Dobson Road\nMesa 85202\n\nThere are as many styles of the ubiquitous Vietnamese dish pho (pronounced PHA) as there are people that eat it, and of course, everyone has their favorite. Having eaten pho from one end of this country to the other, this is my favorite place to eat this wonderful dish.\n\nWe were seated immediately, and our drink order was taken. This isn't a fancy restaurant, but you wouldn't know it by the attentive service and spotless tables.\n\nCompanion and I started out with the Goi Cuon ($3.45), which are soft spring rolls filled with shrimp, pork and veggies and served with a delightful peanut sauce. If it were not for the fact that we were there for dinner, I'd probably have made it a double order and had just that, they were so good. Being made with soft rice paper brought a whole new texture to the party, and I loved the peanut sauce with it.\n\nFor main courses, companion ordered Pho Dac Bjet Bo Vien ($8.25) which is a soup tureen sized bowl of wonderful broth, filled with noodles, rare steak slices, flank, brisket, tendon, tripe, and beef meatballs, and asked for the tripe to be left out, since companion isn't fond of it. It was no problem for the kitchen to prepare it the way companion wanted it.\n\nI ordered the same thing but with extra tendon ($3.00), since I love the texture of this item. \n\nIn making their broth, it is simmered for a minimum of 24 hours, which results in a hugely flavorful base for the pho. For those that don't care to have some of the more esoteric ingredients in their pho, there are many choices on the menu including a pho made with chicken breast and another one that is vegetarian. The pho is served with a plate of fresh Thai basil, bean sprouts, lime, and jalapeno's for those that like to add to the bowl. I always add some fish sauce which is on the table because I love the flavor of it.\n\nIt's hard to describe a bowl of pho except to say it is a meal in a bowl that is huge! If I eat this for lunch, my meals for the day are taken care of, since it is so big. (Yes, they will provide a take out for the rest if you need one.)\n\nFor those that prefer something other than pho (there are 16 varieties of pho), there are also 15 other types of soup on the menu, as well as 11 types of salads, 6 vegetarian selections, and a number of steamed rice items as well. Kids are welcome and have their own selections.\n\nRestrooms have always been clean when I have been there, and service is so friendly you feel almost like your eating in a friends house.\n\nI give them 4 stars for service, quality of food, and cleanliness.

"My husband and I have lived in Kuala Lumpur for almost a decade. We already have a few favorite Italian restaurants (Nerovivo, Nerotecca, Sassarosso, etc. for non-hotel Italian restaurants) but we were invited to a wine pairing dinner at Ciao recently so we thought it was a good opportunity to try yet another well known in-town Italian restaurant. The ambience both inside/outside is lovely. It's obviously a well known venue for weddings/celebrations with a separate glass room outdoors adjacent to a manmade pond; very pretty indeed. Outdoor dining is possible (with strong overhead fans I noticed as well) and there is a very nice bar inside with a large seating area to choose from. It's a combination of rustic, romantic and upscale design.As we were part of a large group of about people, I am not sure we had the best offerings from the kitchen and later I checked and they were indeed not on the usual menu. With this in mind, the food was only average. The starter was a fresh crab salad but the crab was a bit soggy and it was nothing special. The middle course was a beef cheeks ravioli of which I found the sauce to be quite floury and the meat tasteless (the pasta itself was well made). There was a choice of fish, chicken or lamb for the main course; I had the lamb (rack of lamb) and my husband had cod. Both were nice but again nothing I would order again. Dessert was a chocolate covered mousse which was not appealing to me at all but my husband enjoyed it (tasted mass produced to me...). I see some excellent reviews so if we lived near by we might give the restaurant another try, but as we already have some superlative choices closer to where we live, I doubt we'll be coming back.

"We arrived at the Peabody and were thrilled when we saw the elegant lobby with the ducks swimming in the fountain.
However, when we were taken to our room, as soon as the door was opened by the porter a very strong smell of damp came to meet us. We asked for another room. The porter contacted reception on his radio and we were instantly given another room. The new room was fine, large and furnished beautifully. The bed was comfortable and we looked forward to our stay. We slept well on the first night but in the morning when my husband was having a shower he was joined by a cockroach. We were horrified and rang down to customer services and asked for someone to come to sort it out. No-one arrived, so I went down to the lobby and spoke to the receptionist and said we needed someone to come to the room immediately and that we wanted a different room for that night. A janitor came to the room and dealt with the cockroach, and we were given a new room on the Club floor. Although the hotel staff voluntarily gave us the upgraded room they did not tell us how to reach the floor in the elevator, and we were embarassed that we could not get to the twelth floor. Eventually a gentleman in the lift showed us how to use our room card to access our floor. We were not told that there was a complimentary breakfast either. So although we were upgraded we felt that it was not done with good grace. When we checked out of the hotel our parking charges were cancelled as an apology for the problems we experienced which we thought was a nice gesture.
The hotel is well situated and the staff are helpful and polite. It was the unwanted guest in our room that spoiled our stay slightly.
The ducks are fab, by the way!!",positive,en

"Estuvimos con mi familia durante 5 días en Enero de 2010,. Lo bueno de este Hotel es que está emplazado en el corazón de la isla de Manhattan, y estas equidistante de todas las atracciones de la ciudad con el Subway que tomas en la puerta del hotel. Respecto al hotel propiamente dicho les comento: que lo mejor que tiene es la habitación compartimentada, es decir que tienes un dormitorio con una cama grande de dos plazas y un living con un sofá-cama, que es ideal si vas con hijos. Posee un baño realmente grande y un área donde tienes una bacha para lavar menaje de “cocina”, cafetera, horno microondas y una pequeña heladera (refrigerador).
Esto es fantástico ya que puedes programar hacer tu propio desayuno en la habitación, dado que los del hotel son muy caros y cualquier desayuno en bares y/o en MacDonals, no baja de u$s 10 /12 por persona.
Esta comodidad que te ofrece es rarísima en la Ciudad de New York, que se caracteriza por habitaciones muy pequeñas y baños diminutos y a lo sumo solo te colocan una cafetera.
Además posee un caja fuerte que programas vos mismo para poner tus valores, y tiene un tamaño que incluso podes gardar tu laptop o notebook.
El servicio de habitación es bueno y el servicio de mucamas también, ya cuando vuelves de tu paseo por la ciudad encuentras la habitación limpia y ordenada. Ademas posee una mesa-escritorio que se puede ampliar y dos TV de plasma de 42 pulgadas, una en la habitación y otra en el living.
Hay que tener en cuenta algo, a la puerta del Hotel se encuentra Times Square, eso quiere decir que siempre tienes ruido, gritos y mucha gente (a la hora que sea), así que si buscas algo mas tranquilo… elije otra zona de la ciudad. Pero como dije antes estas en el centro propiamente dicho de la isla. Estas a 10 cuadras del Central Park y a 8 de Macys, por lo tanto puedes ir caminando.
Secretos a la hora de reservar el Hotel: 1) Inscríbete en el programa de la cadena (Hilton HHonors), y así conocerán tus gustos de habitación de antemano (por ejemplo, lejos del ascensor, no fumador, pisos altos, etc.) ya que si tienen disponibilidad priorizan los mismos; 2) Paga y/o reserva la habitación mas barata, ya que luego de la registración y/o pago con tu tarjeta de crédito te aparece la opción de un “Upgrade” de habitación. Estas opciones comienzan en u$s 5 (que con mas los taxes e impuestos rondaran los 8). El sistema funciona así: vos pagas y/o reservas la habitación mas abarata y luego pedís que te consideren un upgrade de existir disponibilidad al momento de arribo al hotel.
En nuestro caso pagué por adelantado una habitación normal económica (que son las que están hasta el piso 4 o 5) y luego por esa poca diferencia me subieron al piso 33, con lo cual tienes una vista impresionante de la ciudad.
Como ‘contras’ puedo comentar lo siguiente: 1) que el sistema de “early check in” es una verdadera porquería. Nosotros arribamos alrededor de las 10:00 AM y no pudimos ingresar a la habitación hasta las 15:00 PM. A pesar de haber informado esta cuestión y no daba la sensación que el Hotel estuviera ‘a full’. Si bien nos tomaron las maletas y las colocaron en una bodega, esto no quita que tuvimos que esperar mas de 6 horas para ingresar, luego de un vuelo de 10 horas.
La otra contra es que el acceso Wi-Fi de Internet en la habitación te lo cobran u$s 15 mas impuesto por día !!!, solo es gratuito en el Lobby del Hotel, pero tienes que tener un laptop con buenas baterías, ya que solo hay tres enchufes de electricidad, así que si hay tres pasajeros utilizando esos enchufes, solo podrás utilizar el acceso a Internet gratis, el tiempo que te duren tus baterías (que para una adolescente eso es un dolor de cabeza jajaja)
Así que solo por estas dos ‘contras’ no lo voy a calificar como ‘excelente’ a este Hotel.
Por lo demás… volvería a elegirlo incluso a recomendarlo.
Ah! me olvidaba… las galletas de chocolate que te dan de bienvenida, son riquísimas… y un secreto… nosotros cuando volvíamos al hotel al finalizar el día, pedíamos una para cada uno y las comíamos en el desayuno !!",positive,en

"We stayed at this property for the first time prior to a cruise on the QM2. As frequent travelers to New York, we had overlooked this hotel. What a find! It will now be our New York hotel. Location is great for theater going. It is far enough away from Times Square to be out of the tourist bustle, yet convenient to all. Upper floor rooms have great views. Ours on the 31st floor even had a small view of times square, but with an open city view. The room decor/design was sophisticated and great style. We particularly liked the bathroom with indigo glass tile shower. The credenza that ran the complete length of the room was very functional as well as stylish. Beds were phenomenal. Linens soft and cushy. Service was stellar. We had married in New York and comp bottle of champagne and strawberries were sent up, along with a nice message. We ate at Todd English in the lobby with friends and the food was amazing. Once again, great food styling and delicious. Creative selections. They offered a three course meal at lunch for 30.00 that was a great buy for food of this quality.
This hotel scored a perfect 100 points with us. As seasoned travelers, this is rare. Congrats to the staff and others making this a great place to stay.",positive,en

"Leider zu instabil am Rechner.
Am Anfang fand ich den Adapter ganz nett, weil er nicht irgenwo herum hing. Leider lockern sich mit zunehmendem Gebrauch die Steckverbindungen und vor allem wenn mehrere Kabel angeschlossen sind, zuppeln diese in harmonischer Gemeinsamkeit den Adapter aus dem Mac. Das ist ärgerlich, wenn man eine externe Arbeits-Festplatte darüber laufen lässt. Das mache ich also nicht mehr, aber das Tablett fällt alle halbe Stunde aus, denn dann hat sich der Adapter wieder gelockert. Ich habe einen zweiten Adapter mit nur einem Kabel zum Mac, der ist sehr viel weniger Störungsanfällig, auch wenn es nicht so schick aussieht. Schade! Der Adapter ist in der Höhe minimal schmaler als die Höhe des Macbooks, darum kippt er immer unter Vollast von vier Anschlüssen ab, was sicher zur Lockerung der Anschlüsse an den Mac beiträgt. Vielleicht hätten ihm 2mm zusätzliche Stärke nach unten gut getan. Wenn die Anschlüsse sitzen, dann läuft alles ordentlich.",negative,de

"For dinner, I opted for Tepian Tebrau due to many recommendations from FB friends. We arrived around 8pm and parking was quite limited, so I dropped off my family and found a spot 50 meters away. Food choices and prices were basically the same throughout this food court. If you sit in front of a certain stall, they will insist that all food and drinks are only ordered from that stall. Seafood is generally the best option, and most are quite fresh. You can basically ask them to stir-fried with sambal, soy sauce or oyster sauce, deep-fry, steamed or boil your orders and most stalls have very able cooks manning them. We ordered Siakap Masak Tiga Rasa or 3 Flavours Seabass which was lovely. Stir-fried Mussels or Kepah Goreng was delicious. Tomyam Campur or Mixed Tomyam Soup was delicious but you can ask them not to make it too spicy. Vegetables we opted for Kangkung Goreng Belacan or Water Spinach stifried with Prawn Paste. For drinks we ordered fruit juices that came in giant tall glasses, and you can ask lychee with watermelon or Air Tembikai Laici which was refreshing. For 4 people, the price charged was reasonable.

"Why do movie makers always go against the author's work? I mean, yes, things have to be condensed for the sake of viewer interest, but look at Anne of Green Gables. They did a wonderful job of combining important events into a cohesive whole that was simply delightful. I can't believe that they chose to combine three novels together for Anne of Avonlea into such a dreadful mess. Look at all they missed out on by doing that . . . Paul Irving, little Elizabeth, the widows, Windy Poplars . . . and Anne's college years, for heaven's sake!!! Wouldn't it have been delightful to meet Priscilla and all the rest of the Redmond gang? Kevin Sullivan should have taken things one movie at a time, instead of jumbling them all together and combining characters and events the way he did. This movie was good, if you leave the novels out of it!! But L.M. Montgomery's beautiful work is something that should not be denied.

"This yoga studio has a ton of classes. Unless you have a really bizarre or super busy schedule, you'll always be able to make a class. The variety of classes is also great and not all of them are 90 minutes, which is nice. I highly recommend hot pilates (60 minutes) or Vegas Hot 90X (60 minutes of hot pilates, 30 minutes of yoga). I took advantage of a groupon which gave me 60 days unlimited for $45. Groupons are for new customers only. They are good about taking the groupon and don't single you out in any way because you are a Groupon customer.\n\nAll hot yoga/bikram studios should have their flooring. It looks like a bunch of rubber bands. It doesn't smell bad and is never wet, even when a class just sweated all over the place. So much better than carpet. A little tough on the feet, but stay on your mat and you should be fine.\n\nThe check in system is pretty cool. They give you a little plastic card for your keychain with a barcode. You scan that everytime you come in and then select the class you want on the screen. Then you need to sign in on a sign in sheet as well (for liability reasons?). \n\nThey have free water from a dispenser, which is nice. Just bring your own bottle. This probably should be a requirement in all of these hot yoga studios. You don't want someone passing out because they didn't want to pay $2.50 for a bottled water or a monthly fee for \""water service.\"" \n\nClasses can get pretty crowded in the evenings. Mornings are much better. They play music in a lot of the classes or before and after the classes, which is different. Some of the music is pretty strange. I swear I heard a rock version of Hare Krishna. The clients are pretty noisy, especially in the evenings, so don't expect a peaceful environment. It's like a crowded coffeeshop before and after class with all the chattering.\n\nThe instructors don't really get on your case if you have to skip a pose or exercise. They encourage the class in general, say inspirational things, and given one-on-one corrections as needed. But they don't get in your face, which I appreciate.\n\nThey use some poses that are similar to Bikram but for the most part it is a lot of dog poses. Make sure you know your basic poses and what they are called. They have you do them over and over again and again. And they don't really walk you through it. They expect you to know down dog, up dog, child's pose, etc. without explaining it. You can always look around and copy someone, but sometimes your neighbor will be just as confused as you. \n\nBetween the locker rooms, there is a box with different slots for tips for the different yoga instructors. I've never seen such a thing in my life and I'm not sure what to make of it. I only tipped a few bucks if the class was amazing. You can also tip online so they are definitely big on the tipping thing.\n\nThe locker room is a decent size with nice showers. Still not big enough to handle the onslaught after a crowded class, but still. They have blow dryers and a vanity area to use. And three restrooms! Hallelujah! Most yoga studios only have one.\n\nIt's pretty far from my house and pretty expensive without a groupon so I'm not sure I can make it consistently. Another issue is that there is always some drama going on. If you want to keep up with it, follow the yoga studio on Facebook. Every so often an employee will freak out, post something on Facebook, get all the followers and clients riled up, then apologize. Or just quit. They lost a bunch of good instructors recently. Plus they keep changing the schedule so check the schedule online before you go. This was the main reason for freakouts.\n\nParking and entrance are located in the back. They did offer kettlebells and Zumba (not hot, thankfully) but those classes are suspended until October while they redo the room.",neutral,en

"My husband and I stayed here from the 18th to 22nd November 2012 to celebrate our anniversary. We had visited NYC before however had never stayed in this particular hotel. On arrival the foyer of the hotel was quite busy with guests checking in and out, however our attention was distracted by Gregg the concierge who presented us with a map of NYC and set about detailing the exact location of the hotel also giving us a note of the hotel telephone number should we get lost. By the time he had done this the receptionist was free. We checked in no trouble at all and were informed that we had been allocated a ""very nice room"" in view of it being our anniversary. We had in fact been upgraded to a suite room 201 ""the Roma Downey suite"" It was quite lovely! The staff throughout our stay were extremely helpful and friendly. Every morning as we exited the elevators we would be greeted with a ""good morning"" and ""have a great day"". Nothing was too much!
I have stayed in a number of hotels in midtown as this is our favourite area of NYC including The Waldorf Astoria, The Roosevelt and The Intercontinental and I can honestly say that none of the hotels match The Fizpatrick for the friendly, personal service offered.
The staff, standard of room and the general ambiance of the hotel made our anniversary stay a very special one!",positive,en
Very happy with this place. My friend spencer and roig had bloody Mary's which they thought were very good. Although I didn't taste. I ordered a bagel because we are going to eat at a buffet later and I thought it tasted slightly fishy. But I offered a taste to 4 of my friends and they all disagreed.,neutral,en

"I can barely find the words to express how utterly utterly awful this film is. I was sold on the promise of action, with Segal and stealth aircraft, which normally make for an entertaining action movie. I can honestly say I'd rather gouge my eyes out with a cocktail stick than have to see this film again. The acting was so awful that it was almost funny. The story was insanely weak, with plot holes so cavernously wide you could fly an F117 through them. The script was so poor, if I found out that a 10 year old wrote it I shouldn't be in the least surprised. The direction and production is so amateur, I wouldn't even hire these people to shoot my worst enemies wedding video. Utter Utter drivel. Those responsible for making this movie have cheapened the art, and they should be ashamed of themselves. Steven Segal should never ever show his face in public again, I can't imagine what made him agree to star in this, the worst film I have seen in my entire life.",negative,en

"Sorry to say, but I cannot give this hotel a glowing report, other than the location. You can not get much more ""in the middle"" of Times Square. If I were excited about walking the sidewalks with mobs and hoards of people who frequent this tourist area, I might consider staying here again. But crowds of this size are not my thing!
My room was comfortable enough. Two double beds. Lots of pillows. For the most part, a comfy sleep. The AC works well. The view was looking down onto 7th Avenue and not directly onto Times Square. The bathroom is adequate, but I wish it had a separate shower from the tub. Plenty of towels on hand. The soap, shampoo, etc. amenities were lacking when I arrived, but they got somewhat replenished when my room was cleaned (on the SECOND day). My room was not touched the day after my first (of 3) nights here. I had been out for pretty much the whole day and was very disappointed to find that nothing had been cleaned or replenished. It was late in the day, and I had plenty of towels and coffee for the next morning, so I did not bother to call anyone. I am typically not a complainer. Some people might try to get some extra Marriott points out of the situation.... not me. I looked for a wall mirror and finally found a full length mirror on the inside back of the closet door. A bit unhandy. The closet is big enough and there is a good supply of hangers. Tea and coffee making facilities are here. Ice is delivered in the evening, along with turn-down service and chocolates, if you want them.
Don't move anything in the mini bar because you are automatically charged, even if you did not take it! There is at least a warning sign to let you know this. I hate those fridges like that. There are times when I like to place small bits of cold food in the fridge, but when the mini bar socks it to you, I don't even try to make space for any left overs I might have in hand!
The internet in the room is fast, and is free for me as I am an elite with Marriott.
The Executive Lounge on the ""L"" level (one floor above the street) has a fantastic view of Times Square. But I can't wrap my mind around an Executive Lounge that ISN'T an exec lounge after 10 in the morning! I enjoyed having breakfast with a view. The food was pretty basic 'continental' breakfast items, but tasty. Scrambled eggs, bacon, pastries, cereals, some fresh fruit, hot oat meal, juices, and coffee.
There is no private executive lounge in the evening. I love having a place to go for a glass of wine, some hot dishes, finger foods, maybe dessert. This lounge, however, opens to the public at some point in the late afternoon and throughout the evening. Elite members have vouchers which are good for 'purchasing' some, but not all, of the items on the menu. Alcohol is not free. The menu is appetizers and finger foods for the most part.
I am not sure why this Renaissance ranks a category 8 with Marriott (if you are using points). I expect a lot more when I'm paying the price I paid to stay here!! Not worth the money, in my opinion, unless location is your primary concern.",negative,en

My friend and I ordered the L.A. Lasagna, one of their signature dishes. The picture on the menu looked delicious, unfortunately the food was not. They were little lasagna rolls and the outside layer was fried. It just tasted really cheap, especially for a $17 dish. My other friend ordered chicken (i dont remember the specifics) with mashed potatoes and spinach. Now that was good. If I ever did come back I definitely wont be getting the LA Lasagna again.",negative,en
"Im Juli 2010 verbrachten wir 1 Woche im Best Western Dragon Gate Inn und waren maßlos enttäuscht: Schon der Check in war eine Katastrophe. Obwohl wir allein an der Rezeption standen wurden wir nicht beachtet, weil die beiden Mitarbeiter zu sehr mit sich selbst beschäftigt waren. Beim Check in wurde uns dann nichts erklärt, alles mussten wir von uns aus nachfragen ( Frühstückszeiten etc.). Das Zimmer war der einzige Lichtblick, denn es war groß und geräumig, jedoch ließ hier, wie im kompletten Hotel die Sauberkeit zu wünschen übrig. In den Gängen des Hotels standen ständig Reinigungswagen, Staubsauger und Zustellbetten, welche die Wege versperrten. Das Personal war sehr unfreundlich und man fühlte sich nicht willkommen. Das Schlimmste war das Frühstück. Dies war im Innenhof des Hotels und das Schrecklichste was wir je erlebt haben. Es gibt keinen Frühstücksraum, sondern nur ein kleines Cafe mit 2 Tischen. Das bedeutet man hat nur die Möglichkeit draussen zu sitzen. Die Tische und Stühle im Innenhof sind dreckig. Alles war sehr unhygienisch. Brot und Toast lag offen ohne Vorleger/Zangen am Buffet. Säfte waren grundsätzlich leer und wenn sie aufgefüllt wurden, dann mit 80% Eiswürfeln. Besonders belastend waren die lottospielenden Stammkunden, welche das Cafe besetzen und auf einem Flatscreen ihre Lottogewinne prüften. Als am 3. Tag dann nichtmal Obst angeboten werden konnte beschwerten wir uns bei einem Empfangsmitarbeiter, welcher sich dann nicht verantwortlich fühlte und uns nach langem Hin - und Her sagte, dass die Info an den General Manager geht und dieser uns am nächsten Tag anrufen wird um das zu klären. Wir erhielten bis zum Tag der Abreise keinen Anruf und sind gefrustet abgereist. Nie wieder!",negative,en

"The lobby of this hotel is historical and beautiful. It's not really a high-class hotel though. The rooms are far from high class. The carpet is dingy and old-looking. The room did not have a coffee maker. I don't think I have ever stayed in a hotel that had a coffee maker. This hotel does have a Starbucks as many hotels do of this type. The rooms are also small. There is little room between the beds and the tv and the bathrooms are small. You wouldn't be able to close the bathroom door if you were sitting on the toilet. You would have to get up so your knees would not hit the door. There was no room to put anything in the bathroom. The bathroom door had peeling paint. The lobby had a lot of people and the ceiling was beautiful. I booked this through hotwire at $79/night ($189.30 with taxes and fees for 2 nights). I asked for a room with two double beds and they said no such rooms were available. They asked if I wanted a rollaway bed for $35/night, and I declined. As with most hotels in Chicago, parking is very expensive, so if you drive in, call some places around and you can get overnight parking at less than half the price of the hotel. The Millenium Park garage is nearby and is much cheaper. The room had virtually no view other than being able to see part of the Jersey Boys sign from a theater.",negative,en

"We stayed here for 2 nights during an Army conference. Overall the hotel is very nice. The lobby is huge, nicely decorated and has ample seating. In the evening they set out flameless candles for mood lighting. They have a restaurant, a bar/coffee area, a gift shop, and valet parking ($51 per day). We assumed the prices we saw for all those things are considered ""normal"" (expensive!) for the Chicago area.
The conference rooms were nice, but the air was too cold in one thereby causing everyone to freeze all day. We were told that the hotel staff was working on it. I am still wondering if they figured out the problem. Our gov't contracted meals were acceptable, but probably not a good representation of the skills and quality of the hotel kitchen staff.
The hotel staff was nice, friendly, efficient, well trained, quick and focused. Valet parking was a bit disorganized when picking up in the AM. We called ahead and waited maybe 5-10 min downstairs, which was great, but we over heard other people complaining that they were still waiting and others had their car already, even though they got down there first. Maybe they didn't call ahead....or maybe they couldn't find their car! Otherwise, valet parking was awesome!
Domestic services was good, they always said hi and told us to enjoy our stay. My only complaint in this dept is that they only put the bare minimum number of towels in the bathroom and when it's 90 degrees outside, it's not unusual to need 2 showers after walking all over the city.
Our room was kind of small, but clean and comfortable. The wall paper was a little loose at the seams and there were a few other minor cosmetic issues, but nothing too terrible. The one thing we really disliked was that the windows were dirty!!! Such a beautiful view, but it was nearly impossible to see due to the dusty windows. They don't open either, so that wasn't an option.
The TV was big, the phone and all the lights worked, but it would be nice to have a smaller wattage bulb near the beds for reading or just softer light while watching TV.
There wasn't a fridge or microwave, but there was a one person coffee maker, blow dryer, ironing board, small wall safe and bar fridge filled with exceptionally overpriced wines/soda/alcohol. A small, highly overpriced snack bar was provided on the desk. We were told that the items are sensored so if you remove them for any length of time, you'll be charged immediately. Not sure if that's true, but if so....that's pretty advanced technology for making sure someone doesn't steal the snack sized Pringles (priced at $5 a can). If they would have priced that stuff somewhat reasonable...such as $2 for the pringles...I might have undulged in those items, but they are priced unrealistically.
The feather blankets were nice, a bit of an overkill during the summer, but much nicer than any other hotel I've ever seen.
I wish they would have put some printed info about the hotel in the room. Such as, checkout time, how to call valet for picking up a car, parking for visitors, and other info about things the hotel offers. I'm sure we didn't take advantage of all the things they offer. For people that don't travel much, they might not know where to find this info.",neutral,en

"We loved the location of the hotel. Center of Midtown and close to subway but still on a little bit more quiet street. We didn´t hear much street noice in the room.
We had a one king bed room. Room was big enough for two people and luggage, and the whirlp0ol at the bathroom was nice. Only we didn´t like the glass wall between bathroom and the actual room as the glass was making noice everytime air flow came from somewhere. But that´s a minor thing.
Fitness center was small but adequate. Overall hotel was always really clean and we didn´t see any bugs or anything. Breakfast was crowded and food quite basic, but it gave you start for the day.

"Very good 1939 film where John Garfield plays another boxer who becomes a victim when everyone thinks he has committed a murder. Trouble is that the killer and Garfield's girl, Ann Sheridan, in a brief but good performance, get killed while trying to elude the police.A crooked attorney persuades Garfield to flee N.Y. He lands in Arizona and meets up with the Dead End Kids.. They've been sent there by a funding program to keep them out of further trouble.Of course, Garfield finds a new love interest but must conceal his identity as everyone thinks he was not only the killer but was the victim in the car crash.May Robson is fabulous as the grandma type running the place for the wayward youth. Claude Rains is also effective in the role of the detective who suspects that Garfield is still alive and pursues him when a picture is snapped of him in Arizona.The film really deals with Garfield's relation to the boys. While the ending is good, you want to see Garfield go back to N.Y. to proclaim his innocence.",positive,en

"I could not believe the unprofessionalism of the cabin crew on this flight. I am frequent flyer and often do 1 or 2 round trips between North and South America per year, usually through Air Canada. This was my first Air Canada rouge experience and I hope to never have another like this again. I found it a little strange that the flight attendants stood at the door as passengers were boarding but they were not greeting anyone, just standing and watching people board. The flight was 4.5 hours from Kelowna to Toronto and it left at midnight so passengers wanted to sleep. I was shocked when I woke up partway through to the sound of loud laughing and women’s voices talking and swearing. I thought it must be passengers in a nearby row. However, I glanced toward the back of the plane and saw all of the flight attendants standing together chatting with no regard for the passengers trying to sleep. I’m sure the whole back half of the aircraft could hear them. Again, as passengers exited the aircraft, the attendants stood at the door but their attention was on each other as they continued chatting to one another and ignoring the departing guests. I’ve never seen a cabin crew act this unprofessional before. I would recommend avoid booking with Air Canada rouge.",negative,en

"I got stuck in the Charlotte airport and was forced to spend the night. I first called the Spring Hill Suites directly to request a room and was told that no rooms were available. Because of the lack of availability at other hotels, I called the Marriott 800 number. The Reservationist with Marriott told me that they showed availability at the Spring Hill Suites; therefore, I booked a room.
On the ride to the hotel, I told the shuttle driver my experience with the front desk clerk. He informed me that this happened a lot and that I should not expect to have a room upon arrival at the hotel…..
Fortunately, a room was available. In summary, the room was clean overall; however, I did not care for the décor. The refrigerator did not work nor did the toilet (you had to hold the handle down for a couple of minutes to make it flush). The breakfast was nice with eggs, sausage, cereals, and waffles.
Because of its convenience to the airport, if I got stuck in Charlotte again, I would probably stay here, but I would not stay here otherwise.",negative,en

"When we first arrived at the Phoenix, I must admit to having reservations. We arrived late at night after a bumpy plane ride, an even bumpier taxi journey and the realisation that my partner had left all of his laptop gear in the cab (we got it back though). The area looked mean, and we were dismayed at how thin the walls were.
However, come the morning and things seemed a lot brighter. the rooms are very big, the bed comfy, and the courtyard supremely funky. It was without a doubt the coolest place I have ever stayed. However, cool does not always guarantee a good night's sleep and on our third night, we weren't quite drunk enough to block out the all-night pool party taking place. We had an early plane to catch so it wasn't ideal! But if you don't mind a bit of noise and plan to party a lot in SF, then this is THE place to stay. No doubt about it!",negative,en

"I was in Houston this past week on business for a conference in the Galleria, an area which has quite a few Starwood properties around it. I settled on the Westin Oaks, a hotel I had stayed at previously a couple years ago that was still undergoing renovations at the time. Back then, my experience was mixed, with the elevators having a mind of their own, the older rooms looking worn out, and the service level was just a hit or miss. Could this time around be any different?
Arriving a couple hours before normal check-in time, I was informed of a room being available and had been upgraded to an Executive King Corner room on the 17th floor. The check-in experience itself was quick, and the agents at the front desk were pleasant to deal with. A couple years ago, the lobby area was only limited to the elevators and the front desk while renovations were going on and the changes were noticeable and quite nice I have to admit. The one big thing one will notice is the major improvement in the elevators, they no longer have a mind of their own and you simply enter the floor number you'd like to be taken to and off you go. The lobby bar area was available this time around, and it had a nice upscale feel to it which was rather enjoyable.
My room itself was a large corner room, with new furnishings that were very similar to other new Westin properties. The bed was indeed ""heavenly"", and I was impressed with the overall look and feel of the room. No longer did these rooms have that worn look to them, and it was obvious that Westin has really done a good job with the room upgrades. The corner Executive King room is very similar to a suite, and is very spacious - one will not be disappointed with it!
Throughout my three night stay, I was able to use in-room dining which was good and much better than my previous stay and the front desk was able to take care of any of my needs. Danny Ruiz, one of the guest relations coordinators had contacted me ahead of my stay asking me if there was anything I would need and made sure my stay was as enjoyable as possible. One of the best things about this hotel is that it's right in the Galleria, so you basically have the mall available to you during business hours and it's very easy to get a quick meal at the food court, walk down to a decent sit-down restaurant, or just pass the time with some shopping or even a bit of ice-skating! As my conference was in the same area, I hardly ever had the need to step outside other than going out to events in the evening. I also had a chance to experience the Business Center which helped me out greatly.
Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by this stay and it's great to see the changes that have taken place at this hotel. A couple years ago, I had the kind of experience which was OK at best and I didn't really know how this time would turn around. I'm happy to say though that this hotel has improved greatly after the renovations, and you might even think you're at a completely different place if you've stayed here before. The rooms have been upgraded and are definitely on par with the newer Westin hotels, the service level has improved greatly, and elevators I'm thrilled to say now take you to where you want to go! The staff was wonderful to deal with, and every need I had was taken care of without hesitation. It's amazing how things change after a renovation, and this property has definitely been upgraded. Other Starwood hotels exist around the area, but I'll be staying at the Westin Oaks again as my choice of hotel in Houston.",positive,en

Pretty good and their portions were HUGE. I didn't finish mine. The waiter also was attentive and kept refilling my drink as I was super dehydrated and drank like 8 glasses of water.\n\nThe cutest thing is they give you these little jars of jam and A1.

I couldn't even get half way before I just have up. The salad was wilted and not fresh. And I don't know about you, but I don't think Cesar dressing is supposed to be sour.

I tried to explain that I wanted someone to look at the bugs to see if the problem was more involved than the sheets. After the second trip to my room, she actually observed the bugs. She then asked, ""You move?"". At the late hour it was and with an early shuttle, I asked, ""Do you have something nearby?"" Of course, the only appropriate answer was, ""Don't know."" I slept on the couch. When I checked out, the front desk staff was completely unaware of the drama. They were horrified and asked for my email.

"We were traveling with all of my husband's family - 8 adults and 5 kids in all. I booked four rooms at this hotel based on our experience at the Embassy Suites in Louisville, KY. Well, I now know after this past weekend that not all Embassy Suites are the same!
We arrived at 4:40 on Saturday - check in time is 3pm. Three of our rooms were ready, the fourth was not. The lady working the front desk killed time by checking around the hotel to see if she had four rooms together on the same floor elsewhere, and then said she didn't. By the time she was done checking her computer, apparently the status of my room had changed to ""Vacant Ready,"" so she checked us in. Let me also point out that she told me housekeeping may be finishing up their ""quality check"" - some quality check, as along with the issues I'm about to list, I also found an empty tube of toothpaste in plain view on the bathroom floor.
Got to our room, and the first thing I had to do was call downstairs for a Pack 'n Play - absolutely fine, even though I requested it on my reservation, rarely does a hotel ever have it in the room when we arrive, so this did not bother me. What bothered me was phone call #2 that I had to make because we had no hand towels, and no wash clothes in our room. Then there was phone call #3 after I realized the housekeeping staff had been so generous as to leave us only 1/4 of a roll of toilet paper, and no extra roll.
Meanwhile, my inlaws had moved into the room next door. They were unloading their stuff, and a housekeeper took it upon herself just to swipe her key and let herself in to deliver some towels. Not even a knock first?
Thank GOD the people in the other two rooms had no problems, or I would have been embarassed, after we talked up what we thought was going to be a great hotel.
Now the pluses - the poor housekeeping lady that had to come to my room three times to deliver items that should have already been there was sweet as can be. The bartender working Saturday night was great! And the breakfast was fantastic. The kids also enjoyed the pool.
I'm in no hurry to return - we actually have reservations at the Cambria on Polaris this weekend, and although we have to pay for breakfast there, My room has always been stocked with the usuals upon arrival. I guess what upset me the most was when I arrived 1hr 40 mins past check in time, and our room wasn't ready. The front desk lady's excuse was ""We had a full house last night and they're running behind."" Well, that's fine and dandy, but if you have a full house, schedule enough employees to get the place cleaned up by check-in time! I would've been ridiculously upset had we arrived at 3pm with a cranky 2 year old needing a nap and we weren't able to check in.
We're planning another COSI trip next fall, and if the rest of our group wants to stay here, I will reluctantly book again. But if I have a choice, we'll go elsewhere.",neutral,en

"耐久性に問題あり。その根源は縫い合わせ部分の布の重なり範囲が狭いことと思われる。
家内用として2箇月前に買ったパジャマです。 サイズ・色合い・風合いも良く、家内も気に入っていたのですが、このところ、布地の縫い合わせ部分にほつれが生じ、（見掛け上）孔が空いたような状況が複数箇所で発生しています。修繕に心掛けていますが、「新品なのに、不都合発生が早過ぎない？」と不満に思っています。 よく観察した結果、縫い合わせ部の縫い代の幅が「極端に」狭く、かつ、「布の裁断部（端部）にほつれ止めがされていない」ことが主原因であろうと考えるに至りました。 とりあえずは自家で補修するつもりですが、今後の購入を検討される方に「お知らせしておく必要がある」と考え、レビューを投稿することにしました。 不都合な投稿でも掲載するフェアな会社であって欲しいと思い、レビューを書きました。 これが公表されるようであれば、次も貴社製品を購入することでしょう。",negative,ja

"In the recent update so far the app has been really good.My girlfriend is currently with some family overseas and its been great to be able to still talk and message with her. But there are a few things that I keep having problems with. First off I keep having problems with the active status not showing things correctly. The active status either keeps staying active over night when she is not using her phone. Which has been making it so that when I go to messege her I end up waking her up because I can't tell if she is sleeping or not. The second problem I keep having with it is that her active status and last active times keeps vanishing completely even though she has the app open in the background and its only been minutes since the last time we messeged each other. With the exceptions of these two things, the app has been great and I am really happy its around.",positive,en

"We booked On The Ave after lots of consideration for our Honeymoon, as we liked it's close proximity to Central Park. After a long flight and taxi ride, we were greeted by helpful staff who took our bags, and checked us in.
Our room was very spacious, massive bed (bigger than kingsize) with clean modern decor, aircon, and great facilities. Good view across Upper Westside and beyond, the hotel is right near a Metro Station on Broadway to take you wherever you want to go.
There are lots of places to eat nearby, including a fantastic deli on the other side of Broadway (next to Big Nicks Diner), or go behind the hotel, towards the Museum of Natural History and you'll find Crumbs Bakery and Shakeshack Burgers - if you go, you'll find out why they have queues miles long!!
Room was cleaned daily to within an inch of it's life, and staff were courteous and helpful.
We were at the front of the hotel overlooking a building site on the corner of Broadway, and for 2 of the 5 days we stayed, the JCB's started up at 7am....we did wonder why there were earplugs left at the side of the bed, but this is really the only criticism we have, and I'm sure the building works will cease soon.
There are also some lovely sun terraces (including a rooftop one), which we did have a look at but didn't have time to use. Free internet in the lobby and business center too.
This was a holiday of a lifetime made better by a hassle free stay in a great location. We will definitely return.",positive,en

The shower also needed a scrub and rooms were really cluttered and tight. I had nowhere to put my clothes so just had to dump them under the treatment bed.\n\nI was pretty disgusted to see that the treatment bed had a dirty plastic covering on it that I was meant to sit on, complete with used wax from another treatment.

"This was our last leg of our flights home to Brisbane.
We had a 12hr layover in Singapore Changai due to the connecting flight out JFK NY being 3hrs late and Singapore airlines rebooking us due to this.
They emailed us the morning before the flight to let us know. Noy good having a 12hr layover but they did there best to get us a connecting flight which is good.
The flight left a few minutes late as they didn't open the lounge / gate until 40mins before the flight and everyone had to be screened to get through to the gate. We got off about ten minutes late but this was made up in the flight so we landed on time.
We were allocated seats 58A&B and were one of the last groups to board. It was a full flight but we still had some space for our bags above us in the overhead luggage bins. We had someone next to us so we couldn't spread out.
The crew were excellent and served the meal after taking off. After the meal, the lights were dimmed and I then accessed the excellent inflight entertainment system and watched some movies on it.
The staff were on the ball and were constantly bring water and juice around for the whole flight.
The only downside to the flight were some inconsiderate people sitting in front of us and putting seats back when you were trying to eat. The crew were excellent and pulled them up on this. Some people just need to be more aware of what they are doing and respect other passengers.
Overall, the flight was good with little turbulence only.
I love flying Singapore airlines as the planes are clean and well serviced, the crew is fantastic, always polite and courteous and ensure the comfort of there guests.
this was highlighted by the flight stewardesses cuddling a baby when the mum was trying to get ready to get off the plane. The genuine care you could see from the staff was excellent. I cant recommend Singapore Airlines enough.",positive,en

"I attempted to stay here while in town for a quick wedding this summer. The wedding was downtown, but my flight home Sunday was early, so I thought an airport hotel would be more economical. Well, I'm sorry I ever did business with this horrible, despicable establishment.
I arrived there at 11am (after waiting about 20 minutes for the airport shuttle to arrive) and requested to check in early. The front desk attendant said no, they could not accommodate an early check-in unless I wanted to pay for a second night (!). How extremely rude! I explained that I would be leaving the hotel at 4am the next morning, so I wouldn't even be staying there for a *full* night's stay, let alone *TWO* nights. I had flown in on an early morning flight and was tired and wanted to rest up before the wedding I was to attend that night downtown, so could I please check in? ""No, sorry, the rules apply to you just like they do any customer"" - that was their response. I asked to speak with management, who said THE SAME THING. There is *nothing* around this heap of junk hotel, so I'm not sure if they wanted me to sleep in the lobby or what (??). Also, the official check-in time on my Priceline receipt was 2:00, and the hotel said they would not check me in until 3:00. I was *fuming* mad, and asked them to take me back to the airport terminal, where I took the $7 shuttle into downtown and stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn (which was lovely) instead.
Yes, I lost my $50 to this horrible, no good, poorly managed junk heap of a hotel, but I promised to write them a very ""honest"" review on Trip Advisor for all the ""trouble"" they went to for me.

"Really, this should be 2.5 stars. \n\nRight before I ate the food I was going to give this business 1 star....here's my story.\n\nI have been craving Chinese food and since I have an hour for lunch (I work right down the street) I figured I'd use my handy dandy Yelp app to find a good Chinese place. Well, this place popped up and the reviews seemed good, so I figured I'd give it a whirl. \n\nWhen I walked in, I was greeted by a lady that said, \""How can I help you?\"" I responded with, \""Well, I'd like to place an order...\"" In looking at the lunch menu, it didn't seem like there were many options for vegetarians except tofu w/ mixed vegetables and tofu w/ broccoli. BORING! So I asked, \""Is there a way to have Szechuan tofu instead of beef?\"" She replied, \""No.\"" I was like, \""You can't substitute tofu for beef?\"" \""No.\"" Kind of annoyed, I said, \""Ok, I'll have tofu w/ mixed vegetables.\"" Then I noticed that the lunch special comes with pork fried rice so I asked if I could have veggie fried rice w/o the egg. She told me that it would be extra. Extra?!?!?! You're going to charge me to take OUT things? That's dumb. So I told her that I just wanted the tofu with vegetables....not the lunch special. She then said, \""Well, we have tofu with eggplant in a garlic sauce....a lot of vegetarians order that. So I said that it would be fine. I was quoted a 10 min. timeframe. I asked if I could eat there and she said that it would be fine.\n\nI went and sat in a booth, which was broken. I leaned back on the back rest and it pushed against the person behind me. That's kind of annoying. \n\nThe waitress then brought me some water with lemon, which wasn't filtered water...it was just normal Chandler city tap water which tasted awful. Good thing I got lemon to kill the awful taste. \n\nMy food then came out 15 minutes later (I timed it). I must say that the portion was plentiful and it was delicious! I was going to give this a 1 star review but since the food was really good I bumped it up a few. I'll give this place another try and see if they're still going to charge me extra to take things out of their fried rice. I honestly think the woman working was new and wasn't familiar with things.....we'll see.",negative,en

"Before this made for TV movie began, I had relatively low expectations. That's because it was made after the final episode of the series had aired and many of the series originals were gone. There is no President Sheridan, Delenn, Lennier, Londo, Vir, G'kar or Lyta. If you remember, on the second to last episode of the series, all the regulars except Zack, Vir and Captain Lockley left B-5 permanently. Now for this film they did bring back Garibaldi (who was not in the last B-5 movie) to join Zack and the Captain and the Doctor makes a brief and irrelevant appearance. But because so much is gone of the old chemistry, this film already is severely handicapped.The movie is about a Soul Hunter (Martin Sheen) who is led to Babylon 5 in search of a globe filled with souls that had been stolen from a hidden repository by an archaeologist (Ian McShane). A lot of spooky mumbo-jumbo stuff occurs but frankly it was all pretty silly and pointless. Yeah, yeah, the station nearly blew up but was saved and all, but frankly I felt like it was a case of ""been there done that--and done that a lot better in the past"".The secondary plot, provided more for comic relief, was much more interesting, as an entrepreneur installed a holo-brothel and those in command weren't sure what to do about it and when they tried to pressure them to close, they were slapped with a lawsuit. This was fluff, but it did provide a few laughs--something the other dreary plot was surely lacking.By the way, Sheen at first did a good job playing the Should Hunter--with his wild eyes and bizarre delivery. However, repeatedly throughout the episode he fell out of character. This should have been spotted and corrected.So the final verdict is this is only for total die-hard B-5 nuts (like myself). Others seeing it might assume the series sucked--which is a great injustice. This is a great example of a show not knowing when to quit.",negative,en

Definitely no extra rice.\n\nToo bad cause the food was really tasty--not as good as tempe but good enough that we would have gone back on a regular basis considering the amount of Indian food that we eat and that is it so much closer to home. \n\nThey lost two customers that would have spent a lot of money just so that they can save a few pennies on rice.",negative,en

"Let me begin with a personal note as a film and television buff, more on the enjoyment side of life: I love what James Woods can do and has done, and I always love Melanie Griffith, and Natasha Wagner was very good in this awful, miserable, stinking ""true crime"" essay.Whoever really wrote this film apparently never spent any time talking to real criminals with real criminal talents: yes, some thieves are junkies but they have very short careers as thieves. Truly successful thieves are seldom caught because they don't do ""junk"" or any drugs before going on a score ( job ).The James Woods character was true to this paradigm in the beginning of this film, and then the script fell apart completely. He turns into a raging, alcoholic lunatic .... nice work for a high-strung guy like Woods, maybe, but not in the least bit believable.Most criminals are lazy. If they wanted to work they would work.These people in this film are beautiful, self-indulgent, drug-addled narcissistic losers. They couldn't pull off a real score in the real world, the real world where a big and beefy security guard who beats the living hell out of a skinny kid ( as happens in the early scenes of this ""DOG"" ), keeps him beat down and doesn't let him up. Ever.How many ways did I find to hate this film ? Many. Even totally vulgar people -- like most sneak thieves and junkies -- have a larger vocabulary than these cretins. And the 'rip-off' scenes with the neo-Nazi bikers ? Puhlease. All rednecks ain't neo-Nazis and those who are neo-Nazi speed dealers just ain't that dumb !!This film earned a two because Natasha Wagner was extremely good in her role as Rose and because Melanie Griffith still has 'that something special,' or at least she had it for this brutal and offensively stupid film. I'm not one to sing praises of real criminals for any reason, but the reality of these criminal types in this horrible film is that they'd all be dead or in jail by Act 2, Scene 1. Watching a lousy Zombie movie would be time better spent than this .... thing ... and I hate zombies.",negative,en

"Aurigny Customer Service staff must be the worst in the world, the recent fog caused some delays at U.K airports, whilst still on the island having a meal before my flight at a local restaurant I heard that there was flight delays so I telephone Aurigny to find out how long etc, I was told no all is well get here on time. Turned up for my 5.15pm flight at just before 4pm and was immediately told story five hour flight delay nothing we can do, went to customer services - who were useless. Whilst I was speaking to a man there, a lady in the back ground put a leaflet on the counter in front of me and said ""its all in there"" and went back to her seat and sat down, the leaflet was about delays, great customer service. We went upstairs and ordered some snacks and drinks and just as I paid, tannoy announced that our flight was now leaving ASAP and was going to Liverpool, not Manchester and that a coach would be there waiting to take us to Manchester. We left everything, checked in and then sat for over an hour in departures. Finally arriving at Liverpool guess what no coach and no one aware of this arrangement, eventually a Liverpool airport member of staff said she was arranging a coach for us, some people asked if a taxi would be paid for by Aurigny and they were told no, now near 10pm and most of the passengers now left making their own way to Manchester the member of staff returned and said she may have a coach for us, and then said where is everyone. Well they have all gone was the reply and we are off too, thanks for the help. Aurigny`s objective was just to get shut, thanks to them I had to make my own way to Manchester at 11pm collect my car and then drive back through the thick fog getting home at near 1am, it would have been safer for all just to get the next safe flight out. When I telephone Aurigny for a refund for the taxi I was told no chance, not our fault and once off the island not our problem and that they are not part of the EU rules. When I tried to put my point I was then told by the young girl on the phone that she was now terminating the call. After a couple of calls I have now been told that I am getting my Taxi fare back but thats it, no compensation for the delay at Liverpool as we were off the island and not their problem.

"The Club Quarters located in the Financial District of New York ended up being the perfect spot for our long weekend in New York. At first I was bummed that we were not staying in a more culturally interesting area but it all turned out for the best. Since the financial district is so quiet on the weekends, it ended up being an oasis in the city. We love walking in New York so each day we used the hotel as our base and walked to Chinatown, SOHO, etc. We also took the subway when necessary.
We also got what I would consider a fabulous deal on this hotel. It only cost 175.00 per night on Priceline. Somehow (without asking) we got assigned the Diplomat's Suite. It had two rooms, two flat screen TVs, a pull-out couch, King size bed, kitchenette (though we did not really use it). The bathroom just had a shower which was fine with us. This was a fabulous deal in my estimation for New York City.
To boot, we had excellent service from all members of the staff.
Unrelated to the hotel, we ended up getting two parking tickets when we parked near the hotel because we did not read the signs properly, so that is a little heads up.
If we could ever score such a deal in the future I would definitely be up for staying in the Club Quarters again.",positive,en

On the other hand, I have had a great deal of fun giving it to friends to watch and describing it beforehand as ""beyond belief!"" ""no words can express how I feel about this"" ""This movie will move you"" As expected, the friends took these nondescript comments as enthusiastic endorsements. They were wrong. The sadistic pleasure I had foisting this on people was well worth the $5 I paid for the movie. On the other hand, one (former) friend says I owe him 90 minutes of his life back.

"What can I say that hasn't already been said about In-N-Out Burger? Probably nothing.\n\nI ate here knowing it was going to be my last gluten and dairy inclusive meal for a very long time, so I totally splurged, ordering a burger animal style (minus the cheese), fries, and a strawberry milkshake.\n\nThe burger was awesome. You can get it protein style, wrapped in lettuce instead of a bun, and that's probably what I'll get the next time I'm in town. The fried onions and the special sauce, as well as the obvious freshness of all the ingredients, proved In-N-Out to be worth the hype and well above Five Guys.\n\nThe strawberry milkshake was grand. The fries were eh. I'm told they are usually made to order, but I am pretty sure I didn't get a fresh batch. They were good in that they weren't too salty, but they could have been hotter and crisper, for sure. \n\nIn short, animal style, animal style, animal style.

"So glad I had a chance to try Craftsteak. The good parts: Setting is fabulous, very posh and yet comfortable. The Parker house rolls were so good that I ate way too many. Crusty tops with salt and pillowy soft insides. The Wagyu beef tartare was as good as others here have said. And yet... The frisee salad was majorly overdressed. Yes, it is a warm salad so the frisee won't be as crisp as normal. But the egg, bacon, and cheese used for the freshly tossed dressing should have been used on three times the amount of greens. Then it would have been an enhancement instead of glops of saltiness that hid the taste of the greens. So sad. I'm sure Chef Colicchio didn't know it was that way because, after watching him so long on Top Chef, he would not have stood for it. Wish I had been hungrier so I could have tried other items. \n\nOn a side note: All throughout my dining in Vegas I was confronted with soup spoons given to me for my dessert course. When the sorbet scoops are the same size as the spoon I'm to eat them with it is not a good match. Craftsteak was one of the offenders.

The bathroom was very small with a tub/shower, toilet and sink with no counter space and a very small mirror with poor lighting for make up application. There was a glass shelf for toiletries. Amenities were very nice and included a hair dryer. Check- in was very good and efficient. Free internet access - The elevators were out of order for one of the days but we just used the stairs.

Soon as we walked into our room we noticed other guests looking into our room through the glass door giving us winks and weird smiles.

"When you mention fast food, Boston Market is never one of the places that comes to mind. In that respect, it's like Wendy's.

When I can't figure out what I want, I don't like going there. This is true at places that have massive menus, or places that just don't tickle my fancy, and it's true at Boston Market.\n\nI think they were one of the first places I noticed where they tend to obscure their menu choices somewhat. Now lots of places do it (see McDonalds), but at those places, I know what I want, so it doesn't really matter.\n\nIn any case - I never know what I want, so I end up panicking in line and ordering something I don't really want, and end up unhappy.

The rooms were clean, the staff were excellent in helping the traveler.They were very warm. Check-in and check out were handled quickly. The bath rooms were also very clean. They had some nice bath robes also, and I was tempted to buy one. The room I had just a street view and was in second floor. Funnily, I could see the office across the street and make faces at them also. They are used to such cranky cases I suppose but views are not that great unlike Hyatt which is a tall building. This is three ( may be four ) floor building.. Not much of a good view that way. But rest of the stuff expected from the hotel was excellent. Pricier than Hyatt Regency Did not try their breakfast or dinner. The place is close to many bars and eateries and hence not really have to depend on the hotel restaurant.

"I always butcher the word nigiri even though sushi is my fortay and I was born in Japan. Finally got to stop into this charming little Japanese bistro for a quick lunch. I must say I do like the place. It has a very attractive decor that reminds me of the Pacific Northwest ( Seattle , Vancouver ect ) and I knew immediately that it would be tasty. I was greeted by a lovely waitress and was allowed to pick my own table . The menu is a good size , not to small not to big. I ordered a simple lunch of Tuna nigiri , salmon Maki and a sweet potato tempura hand roll. I do prefer the simpler rolls because usually if the simple rolls are good at a place the rest of the food is bound to be . I especially liked the tuna nigiri . It was a different cut from the fish and was a bit firmer but also melted in your mouth. Usually your tuna cut is very soft and easily comes apart but having a bit firmer cut that has the characteristics of the normal sashimi cuts was very refreshing! I am told by the owner that it is cut from the belly of the fish and that they buy a whole fish from the market and the chefs prepare it and cut it all themselves. Note, most sushi places do not buy the whole fish they buy specific cuts and then take from there. This is very unique to a place like Edinburgh that doesn't have your sushi places like Seattle or San Diego or of course Japan. I'd stop in just to try different cuts from the fish and promote places that do this. The salmon maki was also quite good and the salmon was nice and buttery in terms of texture . I quite enjoyed it. The tempura hand roll was also yummy just a little to much rice for me but that's ok. The tempura itself was perfect. I do wish the wasabi was a bit hotter but I know it's hard to find real wasabi . I did get to chat a bit with the owner who told me about their up coming plans and a little bit about the business and such. Nice gentleman . I will be coming back to try some more of the dishes. Just remember this place is a Japanese Bistro not a sushi restaurant so there is more to try here then just sushi, and I have a feeling it will be just as good if not better!",neutral,en

Very disappointed and would not go again unless they can assure they will bring back the good old laksa paste.Place is not as crowded as it used to be.

"The first visit, I was intrigued. The second, I became a fan. From that point on, I could not help, but tell people about this place. The concept of taking something as simple as a classic meat pie and filling it with some extravagant ingredients might just work. Well, of course it would work. The important thing is perfecting the crust that allows the fillings to shine. \n\nFor the most part, this does happen. Some of the pies are overshadowed by strong or overpowering spices, but overall they are delicious. The Porky, for instance, is overcome by sage. All of the other ingredients are taken over by this one spice. The Royale with Cheese is one of my favorites though. To have all of the best components of a cheeseburger in a handheld snack is amazing. My only complaint is the lack of consistency in their menu. Instead of doing such a large selection, maybe to offer specials on certain days or setting specific days for each pasty would make it easier to keep plenty. The soups have all run salty every time I ordered one. The sides are hit or miss. The oven fries with jalapenos and garlic are always delicious.\n\nThe beer selection is reasonable and affordable. Although it is not a huge variety, it is enough to over all of the bases.",neutral,en

"This hotel is nothing special: the rooms are ok, but not great. If you want to stay in a famous hotel, this would be a good one because it is not too expensive. The best part about this hotel is the location. We found difficult to ask for a 2 bed rooms and only got an extra bed instead. When they brought the extra bed, the person who brought the bed was not happy and you can tell, which I thought was rude, but may be normal for NYC.

He was extremely responsive and open to my ideas while recommending options to consider. \n\nMy birthday cake was a chocolate cake with cookies and cream filling. It was moist, flavorful while being classy and gorgeous. My husbands was a custom chocolate cake with peanut butter icing. Delicious! When the waiter brought the surprise cake to the table he complimented on how this was one of the coolest cakes he had ever seen. Retro is our go to place while partying in Vegas.

起動する度に音量がリセットされるので、毎回設定しなおす必要があり、それを忘れて音楽を流すと耳が痛くなるレベルでの大音量に嫌気がさす。 iPhoneを使った場合、使用するアプリによっては、iPhone側からの音量調節が出来ないこともある。 音量３０%以上では明らかに音質が変わり、安物のテレビ用スピーカーをキンキン鳴らしているような質感になる。 ある程度の音質を保ったままボリュームを上げたいなら、ウォークマンなどの音質を細かく設定出来るプレイヤーを使った方がいい。 最小の音量でもそこそこな音量が出るのでアウトドアには向いているかもしれないが、自室で夜間に寝るまでの間音楽を流す的なことには向いていない。 いずれにしてもプレイヤー側で音量 音質共にかなり変わるので使い道を選ぶスピーカーだと思う。,negative,ja

Ben G fans should stick with just about any other movie he's been in. Dorothy S fans should stick to Galaxina. Peter B fans should stick to Last Picture Show and Target. Fans of cheap laughs at the expense of those who seem to be asking for it should stick to Peter B's amazingly awful book, Killing of the Unicorn.",negative,en

"My partner says that I should only give the Andaz 2 stars: she says the only thing she liked was the service. The furniture was cheap and not attractive, no coffee in the room, no iron...
I thought it was moderately ok. The lobby was very uncomfortable with sitting areas mixed with the reception area, no bar, no gift shop, no driveway to park while unloading luggage. The breakfast was far below what I'd expect at a Holiday Inn: muffins and coffee and apples? no eggs, toast, meats, cereal, etc. Cocktail hour included wine and sugared walnuts and cookies, even then it lasted only 2 hours whereas other hotels we've stayed at recently had 4 hours. Fortunately there is a good NYC diner a few blocks away.
There was one server for wine and coffee causing a lineup of guests waiting for a beverage.
I particularly disliked the room decor. At first it seemed cute to have a transparent glass door to the bathroom and a glass panel between the tub and the bedroom. Soon I realized that when the glass door was open it blocked the halllway between the front door and bedroom, causing me to crash several times. The rotating full length mirror, added to the clear door, created a kind of fun house enviroment.
I especially didnt like not having a top sheet under the comforter. I hope they wash the comforter cover every day!!!
I did like the proximity to the Seaport, Ground Zero, Battery Park and even walking distance to Tribecca.
On impulse we got on the State Island ferry which was a few blocks away and had a wonderful one hour round trip for Free, across NY Harbor and past the Statue of Liberty.
On this trip we've stayed at Marriott Renaissance, a Hampton Inn and a Hilton. The Andaz was the least enjoyable.",negative,en

"Arriving for a Sunday brunch, the place as buzzing, though not packed. However, even with the number of workers around, service was slow. The orders came in really odd moments even though it was ordered at the same time. The signature pasta (The Wolf's Favorite) was far too sticky and the yolk, while enhancing the flavor, contributed more to the stickiness which ruined the pasta slightly. The Eggs Benedict was equally disappointing, perhaps I've had expected more looking at the price (RM17), but two eggs and some sad bacon strips on two pieces of burned toast was not it.Considering the portion, taste and price, the value for money here is quite poor. The service didn't help improve the experience, food was largely dissapointing, environment was bustling though I've expected that and the location could be a bit weird, though being familiar with the area there was no problem faced there.I can't say I will come back again though this is not a bad place by any standard, just perhaps I came with an higher expectations. Perhaps dinner and being able to sample their Pork Ribs might be a better experience next time around. For breakfast / brunch though, there are far better places nearby for now.",negative,en

Best spot for Chinese noodles in Las Vegas! The wait can be insane on weekends during lunch time. I've waited 30 min to an hour on Sundays for a table...usually if this is the case I'd just leave but my grandma absolutely loves this place. \n\nThis is not the nicest chinese restaurant that you'll find in Las Vegas but the food is great! They serve the usual entrees that you would find in most Chinese restaurants but their specialty is their delicious noodle soups and BBQ entrees. \n\nMy go-to order here is a bowl of wonton egg noodle soup with the thin noodles with a side of chinese brocolli that is served with oyster sauce. These items sound simple but always leaves me satisfied and happy as can be. Their roast pork is delicious as well. I usually would avoid eating the skin of pork but that would be a sin here.\n\nMost of the employees speak both Chinese and Vietnamese which I found pretty impressive. Their English is for the most part...broken..so be patient...you won't regret it. The food and affordable prices will have you coming back time and time again.,positive,en

"I made my reservation using our company travel agency. The confirmed daily rate was for $117.00 per night. However, the hotel charged me $126.00 per night. Speaking with the assistant manager, the printed confirmation number and rate is not valid. He refused to honor the confirmd $117 rate by making the adjustment at the time of check out. He instead offered to process a refund which would take 7 to 10 days. I'm a priority club member, platinum status and for the last five years all of the confirmed rates have been honored by the hotels I have stayed in. I'm on the road 80% each month...I have earned the platinum status.
In respect to the accommodations, the drain in the shower was clogged ...needless to say a major inconvenience. Within seconds I was angle deep in water in the shower. I had to rinse....turn off the water.....lather...wait for the water to drain...rinse...turn off the water...lather....repeat. There was only one remote control for two incompatible TVs. Some of the channels in one TV were not accessible on the other TV. The carpets are very very dirty. I never walk barefoot in a hotel. The whites socks were dark grey within an hour just walking around the room. Luckily, I carry extra socks with me for those hotels that dont wash the carpets regularly.

"The first half hour or so of this movie I liked. The obvious budding romance between Ingrid Bergman and Mel Ferrer was cute to watch and I wanted to see the inevitable happen between them. However, once the action switched to the home of Ingrid's fiancé, it all completely fell apart. Instead of romance and charm, we see some excruciatingly dopey parallel characters emerge who ruin the film. The fiancé's boorish son and the military attaché's vying for the maid's attention looked stupid--sort of like a subplot from an old Love Boat episode. How the charm and elegance of the first portion of the film can give way to dopiness is beyond me. This film is an obvious attempt by Renoir to recapture the success he had with THE RULES OF THE GAME, as the movie is very similar once the action switches to the country estate (just as in the other film). I was not a huge fan of THE RULES OF THE GAME, but ELENA AND HER MEN had me appreciating the artistry and nuances of the original film.",negative,en
"The reason for my rating: I don't appreciate paying for wifi and I don't like to pay surcharges on already over-priced room service. Other than that, I found the location and appointments worth the discounted price that I paid.
I used a discount website to book this hotel - one of those ""secret savers"" deals. The property was revealed after I paid my $86. It was worth that price to me as I was attending an event 2 miles away at Mile High/Invesco/Sports Authority Field. I wasn't driving, so I knew I wouldn't have to worry about the parking charges, and after reading other reviews I requested a room in the main hotel rather than the tower and they accommodated me with no hesitation.
The 4-star qualities: location, service, property amenities, room comfort. I had a great night's sleep even though I was the first room by the elevator. I am a light sleeper, so I was pleasantly surprised by the lack of noise at night. Also, the air conditioning is quiet, which is why I often look for 4-star properties on discount websites. The room was large, the bed and pillows were very comfortable, the bathroom was roomy (needed more light though), and the desk and TV appointments were good. The air conditioner was quiet - and this is a very big part of why I seek 4-star properties at a discount.
The 4-star cons: as I mentioned right up at the top - charging for wi-fi and $3.50 surcharge on top of inflated room service prices. (the $12 mediocre quesadilla was a $20 item after tax, surcharge and tip) I find this ridiculous, but I tolerate it because the quality of beds and air conditioners in 4-star properties provide for me (a light sleeper) a much more restful stay.
I know the company line is ""our wi-fi charges are comparable to our direct competitors"" or something along those lines. But we all know that they charge for it because much of their clientele will simply put wi-fi on their expense account. It seems that 4-star properties don't mind that the message is that the average tourist traveler who scrimps and saves for a little luxury during their vacation is not as important, and they can either pony up the daily internet charge, or they can sit in a busy, noisy lobby to use the free wi-fi. It's ok, 4-stars. We get it. It's an easy $15 a day x1000's with almost no extra work or capitol expense required on your end. Even though hotels like this probably pay a little for someone to spend time rebutting the same complaint hundreds of times on sites like this, that cost is worth the investment. We get it. But it still stinks.
If this (or any other) 4-star property would stop charging for decent wi-fi, I bet that they would get much happier reviews instantly. Maybe someday they'll get that message and be bold enough to go against the 4-star grain. In any case, I paid for wi-fi so I could access the internet in my quiet room. There are 3 speeds of access you can pay for at the price points of $10, $12 and $15. I went for the middle one.",neutral,en

"This place has decent food but I am surprised by the people who gave it 4 or 5 star rave reviews. It's not bad, but it's nothing special either. \n\nI went in on Sunday for a late lunch with 3 other people. We all liked our food but agreed that it was pretty much the same as any other Mexican restaurant. I was a little disappointed since the menu did not have a lot of choices and what was there was pretty basic. One of the people at the table ordered the combo plate they were told that they were out of tamales so she had to sub another taco. So, the four of us got chicken rolled taquitos, beef fajitas, carne con chile, and tacos. Wow, real exciting stuff. \n\nThe pluses for this place are the variety of salsa that come with chips before the meal and the free sopapillas. Again, nothing really wowed my taste buds, but both were a nice touch. \n\nThe waitress was very friendly but the service was spotty. She refilled our drinks before they were even empty but failed to notice that we did not have napkins or silverware until we pointed it out to her... after our meals had been brought out. \n\nOverall I didn't hate it; but I will not be back again since there are other Mexican joints closer to my house that have the same boring food so it really is not worth the drive for me.",negative,en

"This was an impromptu trip, no planning, set up by travel agent and GoGo vacations, had no idea what to expect, and did not read reviews before going. It was our 30th anniversary and had no kids involved. We are not Hilton regulars and had no extra incentives. We wanted a relaxed atmosphere, spa treatments, and good food. We requested a balcony room for privacy which was unavailable due to the Memorial Day weekend crowd. Was given a room with a ""patio"" which was less than 3 ft wide and was regularly occupied by children from other rooms.
The spa was excellent, use of the spa gave us access to the spa pool and all other facilities which was wonderful. The pool area was much better than the other pools and we practically had it to ourselves. The treatments are expensive but worth the cost.
Dinner at the Antlers Lodge had the distinction of being the most expensive meal we have ever had. However, my compliments to the chef. The food was excellent. The atmosphere was also excellent with enough space between tables for privacy. The service was flawless. I can recommend the bison steak and tomatillo soup.
The breakfast buffet was good but expensive at $21 a person. Drinks were also high at $10-12 each so we didn't have to worry about getting drunk.
The place is great location for a family vacation/Seaworld trip. It is 20 minutes and $50 plus tip cab fare each way to the Riverwalk. There were lots of kid oriented activities this weekend. There were very few adult oriented activities.
The rooms were comfortable but the walls were thin. The fighting kids next door woke us up at 6:30. The shouting mother trying to control them was even louder. I could have complained but that wouldn't have gotten us more sleep.
One of the worst problems I had was lack of Internet access. Neither my iPhone nor my iPad would work in the room. I called Internet help desk 4 times. I finally was able to log in outside. However, nowhere inside the room could I get service. My regular cell service didn't work either due to the heavy limestone walls. One call to the help desk netted me a curt ""It's because you have an iPad."" I used it outside until I had fed half the San Antonio insect population. I spoke about the problem to the concierge. I was surprised that I wasn't offered even a token of compensation for this. We spent over $1200 on food and spa services alone this trip. You would think they would want us to come again.

"We haven't been here in awhile so we decided to go last Sunday to see if it was as good as we remembered. It was pretty busy, and busier than their norm, so the service was lacking, but the sushi was amazing! Definitely on par with the sushi restaurants on the strip. I heard before that the owner was the head sushi chef at nobu and it definitely shows. A lot of the menu items are almost identical to nobu's menu. But I didn't mind that at all since nobu is my fav! However, soj goes further outside of the box with their menu. For sushi lovers I would definitely recommend the shin's special plate. It was amazing! Delicate, beautiful, fresh pieces of assorted sushi each topped with a special sauce. I would also recommend the yellowtail and salmon in spicy ponzu sauce.It was beautiful and delicious as well. We also had the Hawaiian style edamame, too salty for me, uni, not the best I've had, but not the worst! Spicy tuna handrolls, amazing. Oysters with salsa, amazing. Tempura, really good. And chocolate cake with green tea icecream for dessert, identical to the bento box dessert at nobu! \nOverall a great meal, will go back again soon.",neutral,en

決して気に入らないわけではないんです。 バンド部分の塗装が適当だとか、金具が少しずれてくっついているとかは まぁ値段が値段ですので。 ただ、つけて３日目でバンドの部分はボロボロ剥げてきて、 途中時間を調整するところが戻らなくなったりはもう少しもって欲しい。 時間はそれなりにあっているし、針はあきらかな安物感がでてますが、 青の文字盤は結構綺麗で気に入っている分、壊れるのがちょっと早いです。 ★３つをあげてもいいかもだけど、到着もかなり時間がかかったし、 これからどれだけ長く使えるかで修正するかも知れませんが 現段階で壊れてきているのでこちらで。 追記です。 上記は購入して３回目の使用の時の感想です。 そして事件は４回目に起こりました。時計は元気なんですが、手首を動かしたところバンドを固定している根本の部分が壊れました。 修理は難しいようです。ただもう少しもって欲しかったかな~。 まさか普通に使ってて根本からとれるとは^^; 自分のがたまたまそうだったからなのはわかりませんが、予想外にもろかったです。 いや値段相応って言われればそうなんだけど。 まさか時計よりも先に固定部分が壊れるとは…。",negative,ja

"8 декабря 2022 заказал дебетовую карту . На сайте написано про доставку на следующий день, но это ложь, такого варианта выбора не оказалось, ближайшее число было 11.12.2022. Но и 11 декабря никто ничего не привез. Только лишь 12 декабря 2022 приехала курьер, которая даже из машины поленилась выйти. Серьезное вроде дело, договор , как можно в машине изучать, ведь не та же обстановка. Ладно, я согласился, думал опытный банковский работник и в такой обстановке всё прояснит. Но это был не работник банка. Просто курьер, которой вообще все равно что везти. Я задавал вопросы, довольно естественные, потому что договор (который почему-то называется не договор, а анкета-заявление) я увидел впервые и эта анкета вызывает вопросы. И получал стандартный ответ я не знаю, зачем мне это знать, я курьер . В числе прочего в анкете , прямо открыто напечатан логин и пароль электронной почты (вида . . , пароль ), для уведомления и подтверждения операций по карте. Курьер связку логин пароль видел, начальство курьера (и это тоже не банковские работники) тоже всё видели, неизвестно ещё кто логин-пароль видели до меня. И после тоже эта анкета - договор тоже не сразу ведь в банк попала, то есть опять неизвестно как строго секретные данные путешествовали. И это ведь не персональные данные, это именно строго конфиденциальные данные, которые должны быть только у меня. Как утверждает сам банк ( . . - - - - ) Электронный почтовый ящик от ПАО КБ УБРиР - это бесплатный канал получения информации о совершенных операциях с использованием банковских карт, предоставление которого осуществляется на основании ст. 9. федерального закона 161-ФЗ . То есть банк организовал почтовый сервис только для того, чтобы не обеспечивать клинтов бесплатными СМС. Но распространив мои секретные данные среди всех желающих, банк УБРИР вот именно меня в мою почту и не пускает. 13 декабря 2022 (то есть в день снижения ставок по вкладам) банк карту активировал, и я даже зашел в интернет банк. И в разделе оповещения по карте действительно обнаружил то самый адрес электроннй почты . . . Однако по адресу . . пытавшись войти в почту я получил лишь сообщение неудачная попытка входа . И до сих пор все попытки оканчиваются так же. По всей видимосьт, кто-то уже вошел до меня и поменял пароль и ждет теперь возможности манипулировать моим деньгами. 14.12.2022 я задал вопрос на портале Банки.ру в разделе вопрос-ответ ( . . - 462810), сообщив (в приватной части вопроса) банку всю возможную информацию о себе и ситуации. (Под другим именем задал вопрос, но это благодаря администрации банки.ру и их постоянным улучшениям). В тот же день получил ответ Мы проверим информацию и вернёмся к вам с ответом, пожалуйста, ожидайте . На этом реакция банка закончилась. Ещё что-то там про персональные данные, из чего следует что по мнению банка строго конфиденциальные сведения (связка логин-пароль например) относит к простым персональным данным (а персональными данными клиентов банк щедро делиться с партнерами). Я изначально хотел открыть вклад, для этого и карту заказывал (иначе не стал бы), но сейчас я просто боюсь перводить туда хоть какие-то деньги. Банк завел почтовый сервер не по доброте, а лишь чтобы формально соблюсти норму закона. Но по факту ничего не соблюдается, этот бесплатный канал получения информации обо мне банк предоставил не мне, а неизвестно кому.",negative,ru

"First, the positive. This is a fairly new hotel, so it's still well maintained and clean (except the carpet, which was pretty stained in my room). It has hip/modern decor, which I suspect a lot of people would be in to. The suites are roomy and had a large desk/workstation that was very handy for getting some work done. The fitness center had nice, new treadmills with TV's onboard. The location is handy to the airport and major highways, but that advantage is also part of its major disadvantage
Now, the negative. The planes taking off and landing late in the evening and early in the morning rattled my bed like we were having an earthquake. Trucks driving by on the road rattled the windows. The walls are so thin that I laid awake all night listening to the guy in the room beside my snore. HORRIBLE night's sleep. I even tried to get up and sleep on the couch to get away from the snoring, but it was so narrow that even a pretty small person like myself (I'm 5'3) had to lie flat with my arms crossed across my chest to fit. NOT comfortable. The thin walls also made it sound like there was a track meet going on in the hallways and stairwells (sounded like a family with kids moving in) I got maybe 2 hours of sleep.

"Checked in late Friday night on a very busy weekend -- Graduation and NASCAR Speed Street. Our first room had two queen size beds and was very spacious. It was also marked as a handicapped room and had a lovely shower without glass doors. Unfortunately we discovered fecal matter sprayed around the toilet (toilet was clean) attempted to clean it with shower and a towel but had no bleach so when housekeeping didn’t clean/disinfect it (twice) -- (left a note) -- we asked to be moved to another room. I Tried to give our housekeeper a chance to rectify the situation. But Scott, at the front desk, figured that they probably didn’t understand the note. He very apologetic and promised to contact the manager. Our stay was for 4 nights and when asked what they could do since they couldn’t offer us a meal (no restaurant) we asked for one night complimentary. There was a message on our home answering machine after we checked out and flew home that we would receive a 50% discount on our first night’s stay for the inconvenience.
During our stay housekeeping also were not consistent in replacing coffee packets, washcloths, or bath mat, and crumbs did not get cleaned off the table in the room. In hindsight, we should have contacted the manager immediately (I was trying to be nice to the housekeeper) and we should have asked to move to a different floor with a different housekeeper!

The QUALITY of the toppings here is what makes this place better than the rest. The toppings taste fresh, candy isn't stale like some of the other places I've been. You pay more for quality here, the prices are higher than most other frozen yogurt places, I got a little sticker shock when I paid at the counter.

"SUMMARY: My Dad and I wanted the old-school, real-deal Vegas steakhouse experience. We got it!\n\nTHE SETTING: Red leather seats, crisp tablecloths, some Sinatra drifting by in the background. Waiters in bowties dressed better than the patrons. DO NOT LET THE CHINTZY FACADE OUTSIDE FOOL YOU - this is serious business.\n\nTHE SERVICE: My father has recently had a stroke, and as such has had to seriously limit his salt intake. This was noted when the reservation was taken, and the hostess took great pains to make sure that everything was setup to accommodate his needs. If we needed water or bread or anything, a waiter was right there to provide it.\n\nTHE FOOD: First and foremost, the tableside caesar HAS to be gotten. Anchovy, raw egg, the genuine article. I do not exaggerate when I say that we ate the salad one slice of Romaine at a time, as each piece had its own unique combination of elemental flavors.\n\n'Elemental' was the watchword for the steaks, as well; simply beef plus time for aging in a controlled environment. Cut like butter, melted in the mouth, crisp on the outside and perfect-rare inside, sitting in a pool of savory juices.\n\nThe salad and steak were so filling we split only a potato on the side, with butter and sour cream. It was good, not great, but hey, it's a potato - it can be done poorly or decently, there is no 'amazing potato'. \n\nThe only slight miss was the creme brulee; the texture was a bit lumpish and it had clearly been kept in the fridge, then quickly blowtorched to melt sugar on top.\n\nThe coffee was excellent.\n\nTHE DRINKS: 2 martinis each, well-prepared, no complaints.\n\nTHE BILL: For four mixed drinks, two salads, two steaks, one potato, two coffees and one creme brulee, $200.",neutral,en

"J'attendais beaucoup de ce film, précédé par la réputation avantageuse qu'entretenaient les admirateurs des deux premiers oeuvres de Roy Andersson. Vous connaissez peut-être le principe : 39 plans fixes, présentant des personnages tous lamentables, tristes et figés. Au rayon des points positifs, il faut reconnaître que la capacité d'Andersson à dessiner de véritables tableaux vivants est remarquable. Les perspectives, les personnages qui se meuvent dans les seconds plans et les mini-histoires qui irriguent certaines scènes parviennent parfois à captiver. Au rayon des points négatifs, le problème n'est pas tant que le film est très pessimiste sur la nature humaine (comme c'est aussi le cas chez Franco, Haneke ou Seidl), mais plutôt qu'il l'est sur un mode un peu niais. Oui, la guerre c'est moche, l'esclavage c'est pas bien, la solitude c'est triste, et la mort c'est pas cool. Mais on le savait déjà. Le film est bourré de tics qui m'ont aussi dérangé par leur caractère répétitif : la phrase que plusieurs personnages disent au téléphone, la musique qui revient tout le temps, le sketch des deux représentants de commerce qui se répète plusieurs fois. Une curiosité donc, qu'on peut voir comme l'illustration d'un univers très personnel, intéressant mais pas captivant.",negative,fr
"I had driven by and seen the sign for this place a few times since reviewing some other Thai places, but just got around to trying it a few days ago. \n\nCorner Thai Kitchen is, fittingly, located in the corner unit of a strip mall. \nDespite the wall of windows, there is nothing great about the view -- parking lot and auto shop. But the interior is cozy and pleasant with a gurgling fish tank separating the entrance area from the seating area.\n\nAs usual, I ordered my favorite Thai dish, panang. And sticking to my vegetarian diet, I got the tofu panang -- along with my first iced Thai coffee. \n\nThe Thai coffee arrived in a tall glass full of ice and my first impression was that it had a smoked flavor -- as if the coffee beans had been smoked. It was also sweet and creamy. The more I tasted it, the more I enjoyed it.\n\nThe tofu panang arrived in a boat-shaped ceramic dish. Unlike other panangs I've had, this one had no peas or carrots, just red and green bell peppers, basil leaves, tofu, and the spicy coconut sauce. While I've never had a panang I didn't like, I can't say I've ever had a version I liked more than this one. It was delicious. \n\nThe waitress and the other staff were very friendly and helpful. The wait for the food was typical and the prices were reasonable. I'd recommend Corner Thai Kitchen to any lover of Thai food.",neutral,en

"Upon check-in, my husband was greeted by grumpy staff. They placed us NEXT to the elevator, when we had specifically requested to be away from the elevators. We stayed here with my two 2 1/2 year olds, and a 10-year old. The room was rough - carpet was visibly dingy and gross. Granite counter tops had been placed over warped, and visible 2X4's holding them up. The refrigerator in the kitchen area had huge spaces between appliances, and cheap, well-worn linoleum flooring. My husband and I were afraid to let the kids touch anything. The TV was lousy and probably the most blurry I've tried to watch in years. The breakfast room (right next door) was scary - mold showing on the base of two walls - at least 1 foot in diameter. The ""Free"" breakfast looked like it came out of the vending machine in the parking garage. It was sparse, to say the least. We ended-up eating out on the second day. It was a joke amongst us guests in the breakfast room on the first day. Many who came in to check-out the breakfast were appalled at both the size of the offerings and the huge gobs of mold on the walls. Some were repulsed like me and quickly left.
The pool was okay, but had some debris in it. The location was right off the freeway and within 15 minutes of Sea World, our destination. There were plenty of nice restaurants and a lot of shopping within a few miles' drive.

This venue has always been synonymous with quality, well thought out concepts - see Kyloe upstairs for an example of how to get it right every time. \n\nMy problem here is that it doesn't really do what it says on the tin. The food is fine, not great, and reasonably priced - a frustration when you know the quality produce that is getting pounded out left right and centre on the 1st floor. The wine list and cocktails are relatively accessible, but certainly not setting my world on fire. The beer selection is AVERAGE, they have something like 10 pumps, and nothing overly exciting that you can't get in the majority of new boozers in town, the same goes for their bottled range.\n\nThe service is the part that makes this a well below par joint, and I know that will come as a surprise to a lot of people. I am ok if you want your team to be super cool, with trendy beards and tattoos all over the place, Timberyard pull it off without any effort whatsoever. But you need to make sure that these guys understand the basics of service. For example, if I order a beer at the bar and am told to take a seat and somebody will bring it over, then I don't expect it to take over 10 minutes to come. I also expect seasoned bar tenders to be able to deal with more than one order at a time. If you are offering table service, then make sure I get checked back on, and maybe offer me another beer before this one runs out, it's basic service. Finally, if you tell me I am ok to run a tab then make sure the bill is correct at the end of the night, my most recent visit was borderline attempted theft as the sheer volume of rogue drinks and 'double entries' on a bill which should have been a couple bottles of wine and a handful of pints was arguably more than just human error.\n\nLike I said, a good concept, poorly executed.",negative,en

"I had my vegas moment here. We had 9:30 reservations at Mon Ami Gabi, and we arrived at 9pm and were able to immediatly be seated outside on the patio with a table against the railing and were able to both sit so wer could watch the amazing views of the strip and the bellagio water show. Our waiter, Chris, was there and attentive with a warm bagguette and a carrot salad that my girlfriend loved, I only got one bite. Next Chris suggested a bottle of wine which was perfect. We started with Duck Confit, which was amazing the tastes and textures were unbelievable. We both ordered steaks which were perfect. Here you can order the cut of meat then any of the sauces you want, these steaks were great. and the frittes cannot be described you need to have these.\n\nWe were not rushed through our meal, nor did we wait on any of the courses, Chris kept our wine glasses full and was very nice. We savored our meal for 2 hours as we watched the bellagio water show 5 or 6 times, and the river of people on the sidewalk would be worth it to watch anytime. \n\nThis is hands down my favorite resturaunt on the strip, it is perfect\n\noh and it was a little windy last night but the angles of the building and the heaters made it just fine to wear a short sleeved shirt.",positive,en

"""The Man In The Attic"" is a movie set in the 1910s. It is inspired by a true story. Unfortunately, it's a story that really didn't need to be told.Looking at the box, the people responsible for packaging the movie tried their best to make this film appear steamy and erotic. They use terms such as ""illicit passion"", ""forbidden affair"", and ""unlimited pleasures"". They even show a picture of Neil Patrick Harris (little Doogie Howser, M.D.) holding a gun!The story involves Krista, played by Anne Archer. She is unhappily married to a gentleman who owns his own business. Edward (Harris) is an employee of her husband's company. Krista and Edward end up falling in love with each other.The supposedly ""shocking"" part of the movie is this: Krista's husband finds out about the affair and forbids them from ever seeing each other again. So what do they decide to do? Krista ends up having Edward live up in their attic. Wow! Krista ends up seeing someone else and Edward gets extremely jealous. So on and so on and so on.""The Man In The Attic"" doesn't cover any new territory. It's a Showtime original picture, which explains why the stars are a couple of B-list actors and both appear briefly in the buff.",negative,en

"Kim Basinger stars as Della, a desperate housewife with a somewhat abusive husband, who gets into trouble while she's out at the local mall doing some last minute Christmas shopping. After placing a hastily scrawled hateful note on a piece of paper and sticking said paper in the windshield of a car that took up two parking spaces, she finds out the owners of the car are the Rainbow Coilition of villains comprising of a white guy, a Mexican, a Chinese guy & a black. They confront her about the note, cap a helpless security guard, and the chase is on. During the course of the film Della will go for hunted to hunter as she unleashes her inner Bronson.I found this to be a somewhat tense little thriller. The acting was good enough (except for a few scenes, the ""Why God why"" bit was cringe worthy in it's badness though) It comes undone a bit due to the sheer fact that the villains Della chases from/after are mind-numbingly stupid. If they hadn't had the intellect of any given ""Home Alone"" baddie, perhaps their eventual defeat would be something to savor instead of the meh reaction it evokes. The unbelievability factor I'm willing to overlook as both the director & one of the producers had part in bringing ""Shoot em up"" to the screen (a film which while throwing credibility out the window was immensely fun). This film while never attaining the heights of that film, was good in it's own rights.My Grade: C- Anchor Bay DVD Extras: Commentary with Writer/director Susan Montford and producer Don Murphy; a 25 and a half minute 'Making-of'; a trailer & two TV spots for this film; and trailer for Lower Learning",negative,en

"Not having been to Las Vegas in almost 30 years, I was amazed at the changes in the city. Unfortunately, I think that the Luxor was built the day after I left the last time that I was here. The TV was about that old. Not that I went to Las Vegas to watch TV. There is no refrigerators in the rooms. No coffee maker, no safe. Hell, there was not even an exhaust fan in the bathroom. I read another poster saying that you get what you pay for, but I found that for the price you could stay elsewhere with more amenities. \nWe went to the breakfast buffet, and I can only say that the food was average at best. What I thought was interesting, was they were doing renovations and they had signs that said amongst other things, please excuse our dust. That is just what I want to see while I am eating, a sign proudly advertising the dust in the restaurant. \nThe next time I go to Las Vegas, I will either stay at a more expensive place, or stay off the strip. I will not stay here again. \nOn a more positive note, it is somewhat conveniently located and I do like the pyramid shaped building.",negative,en
"My husband and I took our two children here on our drive home from DC Memorial Day weekend after staying at a Residence Inn (owned by Marriott). We were a bit disappointed with the lack of attention and customer service after having such amazing customer care in VA. The first sent us to the wrong room when we arrived, forcing us to lug our baggage back down to the lobby and try again. But when were finally settled we found the room to be adequate. It was not overly comfortable but there is a chair to relax in so you are not forced to sit on the beds. The pool was nothing special so if you are planning on taking children and they are swimmers, they might be disappointed. It is basically a lap pool in the shape of a T and becomes overly crowded quite quickly. This hotel is in a fabulous location and it is in walking distance to most attractions. The lobby is spacious and allows for a nice rest... as does the hotel bar. Personally, I do not care for Valet parking- but that is what this hotel offers. I like easy access to my car when I need it or have forgotten to bring something into the hotel. If you are like me and would prefer to have access to your car at a moments notice, I suggest going to the public parking garage across the street. We did not eat at the hotel as the prices and atmosphere were a bit high and stuffy for a family with small children. We found some great restaurants near the waterfront that were quite family friendly.",neutral,en

"I once gave this place 4 stars. But with two occasions where my friends or I have been disrespected by the security is RIDICULOUS.\n\nFirst time, I was taunted by someone who worked there themselves. But that was easily forgiven. Second time was the last straw, a friend of mine was pulled to the side and told to give up her ID. I butted in and asked why, I'll provide privacy for the security individual but he said, \"" She is clearly intoxicated and stumbling.\"" Which was a totally bogus reason. I asked the other security guards and had no idea either. The crowd I roll with never ever causes troubles, and usually buys a good amount of drinks providing business. But Marquee, you sure did mess up, and have lost a huge amount of customers. I suggest you review your security team, and stop getting muscle heads who have too much protein in their brains.\n\nMoving forward from my rant, the facilities here are good. It is clean and there are bars EVERYWHERE. There are different \""rooms\"" here and it is nice to step into another area and have a different genre of music and a different crowd of people.\n\nLastly what gives marquee such a low rating in my book is their poor poor layout. Seriously? Stairs? I know the ladies will have a hard time after a night of drunken dancing, safely walking down the stairs. Someone is bound to get hurt and probably sue.\n\nI had a great time here at Marquee, but unfortunately, I am always weary when it comes to their security.",negative,en

"Truly awful service which is getting worse by the minute. They removed the stream on two devices system and now charge an extra £5 a month for ‘boost’ if you want to continue with a benefit you were already paying for. To cover up this blatant money grabbing from their loyal customers, they glossed it over with ‘you can now stream on 3 devices and have ad free viewing’. Well ad free viewing was never an issue before and I only want to stream on two devices so they are essentially ripping their customers off and trying to pass it off as giving us a better service. Forcing them to pay an extra £5 a month when they did not even ask for these extra benefits. I followed through a complaints process with this horrible provider and had a manager named Hozefa managing my case, well, they closed my complaint without even answering my questions and we’re not even bothered by the fact I was clearly upset and wanted to leave. Their first response to my initial complaint was that ‘they haven’t increased the cost to my current package, we have only added benefits’ well, as you can see, this was a blatant lie as I could stream on two devices before but I now have to pay an extra £5 a month for boost to keep that same service? As I mentioned above, they are charging you extra and trying to hide it at the same time with blatant lies. Clearly they have no regard for their clientele and they are more concerned with taking peoples hard earned money than providing them with a decent service. Bear in mind, all of these increases came on the back of a worldwide pandemic, where countless people are earning less or have lost jobs completely.

I had the tortilla de papa, which was pretty good, and my partner had a chicken dish (name escapes me) that was pretty good as well, and the salads were good. \n\nBack to the pricing thing: they do have Inca Kola, which I love, but they charge $2.50 for a can. I only got one because my partner had never had one, but $2.50? Really? I know the profit's in the drinks for restaurants, but a 12-pack of it cost the same as a 12 of Coke the last time I saw it in a grocery store.\n\nService was good. Very friendly. 4 stars.\n\nDecor leaves much to be desired. This is usually an area that doesn't bug me too much with restaurants, but this place looks ratty - worn carpet, cheap tile, faded pictures of someone's trip to Peru, furniture that looks like it belongs in a chain motel breakfast room. The knickknacks for sale are nice, but they're not in a separate area, so it feels like you're eating in the middle of a gift shop. Again, not awful if you're charging $5-7 or so per plate, but not when you've crossed the $10 threshold. 1 star.\n\nI'm split between 2 and 3 stars, but I'm skewing low on this place.",negative,en
"This place needs some improvement and I'm not gonna be too harsh on them since they are new and are probably still getting a hang of things.\n\nWhen I first walked in, I was the only customer in line. There was a cashier and a manager (probably owner) at the register doing some cash handling/drawer type stuff for about a good 2 minutes it seemed without acknowledging my presence. I understand they were totally focused on doing their cash handling business but a quick \""Hello, we'll be with you in a moment\"" would have been appreciated. It was NYE so I didn't get upset because I didn't want no tricks to be killin' my vibe. I just kinda let it go and browsed the menu while they counted their drawer. \n\nWhen they were finally done, the friendly cashier took my order and while I was getting my drink, I witnessed a gentleman pick up his to go order. The girl repeated his order and I heard him say \""it was supposed to be no tomatoes.\"" And I just watched the girl just say \""oh, sorrry.\"" There was a pause for a moment then she says \""your total comes to...\"" The guy just payed and walked away figuring it's just a lost cause. Maybe he didn't want his vibe killed either and just didn't want to bother.\n\nUpon selecting my table, I was defaulted to the least dirtiest one. The one that was closest to the bathroom that had a tinge of sewage smell mixed with air freshener. All the tables were dirty and the trash cans were full with trash hanging on the sides but none of the employees came out to clean until I was already done eating. And it was not busy, there was definitely some down time for someone to have checked the dining room. You got time to lean, you got time to clean.\n\nOkay, now on to the good. I ordered the pastrami burger which came out super juicy and cooked just right. The pastrami slices were not too thick--which I hate. I prefer thinner cuts of pastrami when it's sitting on my burger and this was perfect for me. The juices were running down the wrapper and my forearm which to me is always a good thing. Get your extra napkins by the condiment station. I have to say it is the best pastrami burger I've had in Vegas.\n\nThe workers were all very friendly but they definitely need to improve on the cleanliness of the restaurant. I really do hope they stay around long because it will be my go to place for when I'm craving a thick juicy burger. I like the fact that it's also less than 5 minutes from my house. I don't really know if that's a good thing though . So bottom line 5 stars for the pastrami burger and 1 star for cleanliness of the restaurant. I hope that next time I visit these things will have improved because if not, it's definitely going to kill my vibe.",negative,en

"Luxor seemed alright.\n\nStuck between Excalibur, the hotel I stayed at, and Mandalay Bay, the hotel hosting the conference I was at, Luxor was a good location for me to pass through on my way to someplace else. The same way most people think of my home state, New Jersey.\n\nLuxor is gorgeous outside. The giant pyramid, outlined in lights and sending a beam into the sky at night, with a obelisk and a sphinx standing guard. Inside, it's impressive as well, certainly more so than Excalibur, where I stayed, but I was sad to see the Egyptian theme fall to the background behind the omnipresent glitz and sheen of Vegas.\n\nNice, for what it is, but I prefer the thematic consistency of NY-NY and Paris.\n\nFor whatever reason, I also found Luxor to be the most oppressive, cigarette smoke-wise. I hated how smoking was allowed in all the casinos in Vegas anyway, but most seemed to have better ventilation or less smoking. I still wish there were designated no-smoking gambling areas.\n\nTo be fair, I was starting to get sick the night the smoke bothered me the most, but still, even after that point I didn't find the other casinos as bad as Luxor.\n\nI saw Bodies... The Exposition at Luxor and found it much more interesting and... enjoyable? (odd adjective to choose here) than I expected. Humans have a surprisingly small spleen.\n\nAte at Tender Steak and Seafood, and I'll review that elsewhere.\n\nI dunno. Not too much to say about Luxor, really. I loved that it shared a tram with Mandalay Bay and Excalibur. I wish all the casinos were on a tram. Those places are too far apart.",negative,en

Unbelievable service from Carphone Warehouse. If anybody reading this is thinking ordering from them on line be warned. I have recently ordered some headphones (2 sets) On arrival over £300 of goods had been sent in a plastic bag. The bag had a split in it and only one set was delivered. On contacting their customer services team (who are based in South Africa) I have been given the complete run around. Firstly I was told that a replacement would be sent and it would arrive within 2 days. Didn't happen!!! I was then told an investigation would take place with their carrier(DPD) didnt happen!!! On my third call some 2 weeks later I was told the DPD driver was interviewed the day before and he confirmed successful delivery of the package and as far as they are concerned the matter is closed. I had to escalate to a manager (Fazel) who was supposed to call me back within 6 days. Still no response 9 days on. Tried ringing twice again today all I am being told their systems are down. In summary they have my money have failed to deliver the goods I have ordered and have therefore stolen from me. So before using Carphone Warehouse be warned they are quick to take your money but appalling when things go wrong. I have now had to make contact with Citizens Advice. The saga continues.,negative,en

"WOW! This is my first 5-star review for a restaurant. I believe that 5th star should be held for something really special that made a place stand out. Fogo did that for me last night. We wanted to go to a Churrascaria for our anniversary, and being the good Yelper that I am, I read the reviews for Fogo and \""the other one\"" which is a couple of miles from my house. Decided, based on Yelp, to make the drive to Scottsdale. Great decision. I made reservations online and noted that it was my anniversary. Got there and was seated promptly. Since it was our first time there we got the run down on the coaster signals and the wine specials and then we were off to the salad bar. The salad bar was good. Not particularly large, but the selections were not your ordinary salad fair. It had fresh mozzarella, blocks of Parmesan to shave, salmon, marinated mushrooms, asparagus. Just great, fresh stuff of which I tried not to over do because of the meat fest I was saving myself for. That's where the fun begins. As soon as we flipped our coaster to green...BAM...meat was at our table in 2 seconds. No joke. Top sirloin, Parmesan crusted pork loin, pepper crusted lamb, fresh sausages, chicken etc.. Medium rare is medium rare, just the way I like it. I could go on and on about how well all the meats were cooked. Tender, juicy, FLAVOR. For those who do not like a lot of pepper, stay away from the lamb as it is definitely pepper crusted. I personally couldn't get enough. Not seeing the meat you want? Just ask a Gaucho and it will be there within minutes. The fried Polenta dusted with Mozzarella was so flippin good, I'm going to have to try it myself. After going into protein shock I decided I was done. My wife wanted just a little taste of chocolate mousse if they had it. They came back with a piece of the most delicious cake I have ever had in my life on a plate that had \""Happy Anniversary\"" drizzled out on the plate..complementary. That was the 5th star!\nThe price wasn't that bad, but the drinks are a bit pricey. Dinner with 3 cocktails was $140. That is more than worth it for a great atmosphere, friendly servers and Gaucho's, terrific food, and genuine hospitality. \n\nThis is my new go-to place for family, friends, and business colleagues. Great job!",positive,en

"Le studio SHAFT se lance dans le long-métrage original, bien loin des films récapitulatifs ou spin off de ses séries célèbres. Le film nous raconte les évènements ordinaires et extraordinaires de quelques adolescents en plein milieu de l'été sur la côte japonaise. Entre romance, amitié et fantastique, le long-métrage ne se perds jamais dans les travers des mauvais drama ou des mélo-drames faciles. Sans jamais donner de voie à suivre ou de leçon de morale, les auteurs se permettent d'insister sur l'idée d'oser faire plutôt que de regretter son inaction, à l'image de Norimichi qui se décide à aider sa camarade Nazuna, occasion de faire l'expérience d'une journée mouvementée et détonante. On retrouve les animateurs de la saga Monogatari, les obsessions pour les décors, et les effets de lumières incroyables, y compris avec le thème de l'eau et des feux d'artifice (d'où son nom). Si l'histoire est simple, et le fantastique assez peu présent, les auteurs se focalisent sur les personnages, à faire partager leur émotions, leur émerveillement, leurs fantaisies propre à l'enfance. Alors oui, ce n'est pas le Voyage de Chihiro, mais ça n'a jamais été l'objectif des réalisateurs. Une œuvre à la fois originale, légère, agréable, et un petit conte alternant entre quotidien paisible et aventure imaginaire.",positive,fr
"I\""ve seen this place gone though many name and owner changes. It's called \""Go Wild\"" now and they are offering the 50% off sushi rolls 24/7. Before you get too excited, I gotta say the rushi rolls on the 50% off menu are about $3-5 over priced compare to other places. So your 50% off is probably equivalent to 30% off, however, still a pretty good deal. \n\nThe inside is a much bigger and fancier than it looks from the outside, although I rarely see more than 3 tables occupied. Because they don't have all-you-can-eat I've only ordered the special sushi rolls. I liked everything, especially the Great White Shark roll and the Kiss of Fire roll, both spicy rolls. The best thing about this place is that the rice on the rushi rolls is sooooo thin.

"Stay at the Skyline if budget is your issue. The room we had was somewhat tired (broken fittings etc) with something of an odd smell from whatever they used to clean the room. The area it is in is not great, but it is only a short walk to Time Square. There is a breakfast option in an adjacent bar, but it looked unimpressive.
Staff were friendly and we found somewhere very nice nearby for breakfast (cafe forant).
Three stars is probably generous - two and a half would be my preferred score.",neutral,en
"Мне недавно срочно потребовались деньги. В начале ноября я обратился в допофис в р.п.Мордово Тамбовского РФ, клиентом которого я являюсь более 5 лет. Специалист по кредитованию Елена И. поприветствовала меня, уточнила цель визита, очень подробно рассказала об условиях кредитования и посоветовала для увеличения суммы кредита взять дополнительно к пенсии доход от трудовой деятельности. В результате очень быстро получил одобрение не только на кредит, но и на кредитную карту с хорошим лимитом, о преимуществах которой я так же узнал от Елены. Ещё Елена мне предложила застраховать дом, рассказала о рисках и условиях страхования, меня это предложение заинтересовало и я согласился.

"I'm a fan. Great atmosphere and the Philly CheeseSteak sandwich was very good.

"We arrived to discover that our reservation for an upper floor view room with a king bed had somehow morphed into a queen room on a lower floor. Fortunately, the desk clerk rectified the issue without complaint.
Our reassigned room was on the 21st floor, and although not the ""odd"" numbered room above Cyril Magnin St. with the best views, it had a decent view nonetheless.
My general impression of the Parc 55 is that it is a good convention hotel, but lacks warmth. The lobby area is sterile and often loud. The hotel restaurants are adequate, but nothing to write home about. The rooms are what one would expect for a hotel of this type - clean, in good repair, with comfortable beds, but nothing to make them stand out. There are probably better values, but we had no complaints because this was a relatively last minute booking and most of the boutique hotels I would have preferred were already sold out - it was a World Series weekend, also the weekend before Halloween.
Some of the previous reviews have complained about the street noise and the exhorbitant parking charges. However, there was no need for earplugs in our upper floor room, and the valet freely volunteered the location of a parking garage only one short block away that charged one-half the daily rate of the hotel garage.
In short, we would return, but not as our first choice.",neutral,en
"Easy and cheap: the perfect combination! Well, for a grocery store anyway.\n\nThe fruit here always seems to be on sale and is much cheaper than most places.

I love stores that are true to their names!\n\nThere's always a fully stocked clearance section at this location, full of food that has just barely hit the \""sell by\"" date on the packaging. I've found fruit, hummus, bagels, etc in there for really cheap. I don't eat meat, but I've seen a ton of different types in there, along with different types of sushi.\n\nThe Fresh & Easy brand vanilla almond milk is SO GOOD. \""How good is it?!\""...Well, it's so good my son asks for it by the name \""candy milk.\"" I've had a few other brands and this is by far the tastiest.\n\nThe employees are very helpful and friendly.

"there is no rating for this hotel...below any standard.
We just returned from staying at this hotel for 7 nights...we were transferred from room to room 4 (FOUR) times. First time they gave us a room with broken windows and no TV...then they gave us a room whose tub and sink were clogged and you couldn't take a shower. After complaining someone left us a pump in the bathroom to help ourselves. Then they moved us to another room with no blanket and a horribly dirty shower stall. The next morning we received a note ubder the door that they have to renovate the whole floor and we have to move again.
The personnel was so rude, they laughed in my face and justified that :""this a 2 star hotel, what do you want?""...No housekeeping services, they left us 3 small towels for 2 people for 2 days, it was trash everywhere in the hallways, the bathrooms in so-called renovated rooms were so dirty....It was a nightmare!!!",negative,en

"Galaxy Express 999 (Ginga tetsudô Three-Nine). Made in 1979. Directed by Rintaro. Based on the original work by Leiji Matsumoto.What little I know of the history of GALAXY EXPRESS 999, it was first published as a popular manga in 1970's and was created by Leiji Matsumoto. GE999 is set in the same Star Wars-type of space universe as Matsumoto's other famous space manga: CAPTAIN HARLOCK. In fact space pirate Harlock and other characters from that manga (including Queen Emeraldas and Tochirô Oyama) make appearances in GE999. GE999 was a success as a manga and was soon followed by also popular anime series which included over 100 episodes. It was aired in 1978. A year later came this anime film, which isn't a sequel to the series, but summaries the main points of the story in two hours long movie. The story is set in unidentified Star Wars-type of future where journeying to different planets has become a possibility. People of the future can have themselves mechanical bodies in which they can live hundreds of years, maybe even forever. The protagonist, Tetsurô Hoshino, is a young boy who witnesses how a cruel Count Mecha, whose entire body is made of mechanical parts, kills Tetsurô's mother. Tetsurô swears revenge and is convinced that he can only achieve it by having a mechanical body. To obtain it he must travel to a far-away planet with space train Galaxy Express 999. However, since Tetsurô comes from poverty, he has no money to obtain the expensive ticket. By a chance coincidence he meets a beautiful young woman, Maetel, who bears a resemblance to his dead mother. Maetel offers a ticket for Tetsurô on a condition that she accompanies him on his journey. And so the journey beginsI first saw this film last October, about six months from now, and again yesterday. I feel that I must first tell about the thing that bothered me the most in this film: it seems very rushed. Then again what can you expect from 2 hours long movie that tries to tell the main points of over 100 episodes long series? Whatever the case, the situations change with a fast speed and Tetsurô meets other important characters in the story mostly by pure chance. I feel makers should have either left something out or include extra 30 minutes. However, there's no arguing that GE999 has deserved its place as an anime classic. The animation itself, very faithful to the style of Matsumoto's manga, is detailed and beautiful to watch. Even after almost 30 years of its release the animation has not become ""out of date"" but puts many later anime films in shame. The music through out the film is enjoyable to listen even if somewhat ""old"" these day (it was the 70's after all). I have not heard any English dub of this film so I can only comment the Japanese audio which is good. Voice actors give life to their characters, most memorable ones being Masako Nozawa (mainly known as the voice of Goku through out the entire Dragon Ball saga) as the excited and young Tetsurô, and Masako Ikeda as the calm and mysterious Maetel. The supporting characters are not left in shadows, but also have a life of their own, most memorable to me being waitress Claire. The story itself is suitable for both those who are looking for an entertainment for couple of hours, as well as for those who try to find deeper messages. GE999 is an entertaining adventure film but can also be seen as Tetsurô's journey from boyhood to manhood. The whole film is told from his point of view, so we are forced to feel what he feels. I think many people can relate to Tetsurô, for despite the fantasy elements, he is a very realistic character: young, hot headed, awkward and naive. We follow him as he starts to see differences between humans and machines and come to conclusion whether he wants the mechanical body or not. Maetel on the other hand stays as a mystery in the film and even in the end, when she reveals who and what she really is, it doesn't much answer to anything. Maetel can be seen as a dream of a growing young man, always close but just out of reach. It's is the strange yet beautiful relationship between Tetsurô and Maetel that still awakes talking and questions, and fascinates after the decades. People have argued if their relationship is that of a two friends, of mother and son, or of two possible lovers (which wakes a lot of critique since Maetel's age is unknown and Tetsurô hasn't even reached his puberty yet). Without any means to sound deep, I think the best term to describe them is ""soul mates"". There is no question that the two feel devotion, caring and love for each others, yet it goes beyond that of friendship, family and lovers. I think that if their relationship would be stuffed in any of those categories, it would take something out of the whole film and of the characters. The ending scene, even if you already know what is going to happen, is still very touching and memorable.All in all, despite the rushing of plot and some corny scenes, GALAXY EXPRESS 999 holds its place as an anime classic amongst the films like Katsuhiro Otomo's AKIRA (1988) and Mamoru Oshii's GHOST IN THE SHELL (1995). The film is directed by Rintaro, who had previous experience of Leiji Matsumoto's works as he had worked in CAPTAIN HARLOCK series. Later Rinatro directed a wonderful looking METROPOLIS (2001) that also questions the difference between humans and machines. GALAXY EXPRESS 999 (1979) is a classic that should be seen at least once by every anime fan.",positive,en

"When I looked this restaurant up on yelp, I was surprised that they only had 3 stars. I hope I can give people a different perspective on this restaurant.\n\nUpon entry, you are given a card and this card is basically your bill. I thought it was pretty neat, being able to self serve and getting whatever you want while charging this card (I found it very dangerous as you can easily rack your bill, just like a credit card, without knowing how much was ordered). At first, I was a little confused because I didn't really know how it worked, but I went to the bar got a drink and gave them the card.\n\nInside, it was very decorative and lots of places to sit. I took a picture of one of the neat tables with the tree in the middle. It gave a feeling of zen within the restaurant. The surrounding tables are a little small, but its nothing to worry about because there are big tables as well. I can see how it could be busy during the day, but I went on a Friday night and there wasn't that many people. \n\nI ordered the Pasta Cognac which I believe was a special that night. It was pretty tasty, but I wished the portion was a little bit bigger. I believe that was my fault because I got the Linguini instead of the other style of pasta, and there were cheaper options with more food. They have a wok and they cook it right in front of you. They also give you free bread, so make sure to get some. Swipe your card and you're off to eat!\n\nI didn't get to try the pizza, however I did drink. Nice 3 long islands as well as a couple of shots for the birthday girl. And, major props to the bartender as he made my long islands pretty strong and tasty. They tend to put a lot of ice in them, so for the second and third one I told them not to put so much ice and a little more of the sour mix and coke.\n\nOn an off topic, in the bathroom there are some awesome hand drying machines. And they have a schedule of the artists that come in every Thursday and Friday night that play live music. If you come, come on one of those nights to enjoy nice music to go along with your food and drink.",neutral,en

"The Sugar Factory in the Miracle Mile shops was not all sweet like it was supposed to be. I ordered the chocolate, marshmellow, waffle cone milkshake that was posted on the column next to the ice cream case. At first I had to wait about 5-10mins until someone of age could get into the fridge to get the milk behind the bar. Then once someone of age finally showed up to get the milk, my milkshake was made. The only thing was, is that it did not match the photo on the column. No waffle cone bits, no hot fudge drizzle. So I handed it back to the employee making it and asked them to make it look like the picture. They added the waffle cone, but had run out of the sweet hot fudge. I then had to leave the hot fudge behind and go for the next best thing carmel topping. Don't get me wrong the milkshake was good, it just didn't look like or have the exact toppings as the picture they portrayed on the column.",negative,en

"Location: great. Two minutes from Times Square. Close by 6-7 minutes from subway. Safe also at evenings for single woman (till 2200 at least).
The room size: Fare enough. Basic but sufficient for sleeping etc. there is a cabin for suitcases and bags, it has a door. Very convenient.
Cleanliness: all right.
The Bathroom:. is very small and if you plan on putting sophisticated make-up, bring ahead a big mirror and remember you'll have no convenient place to pamper yourself. The bath tub is in the standard size and you have warm water whenever you need. No shower head that you can hold in your hand, though. The air condition: as many pointed before, it is sometimes noisy and you're advised to bring ear plugs.
The service: answers immediately and solves the problem (the air condition was only warming)
Breakfast: downstairs is the Café Edison which spares you the search of a diner in the mornings. Wide range of dishes. Fare prices. Work quickly.
Coffee: at the corner there's a Starbucks branch. Very convenient.

"Came here for some take out the other day and had the ol wtf?! moment when I got home. Here's why...\nThe Cabana Salad with added chicken tikka ($10.50) was disturbingly poor. First off, for it to be even a $8 salad (w/o the chicken added) is insulting. It's similar to a side salad you get at McDonalds (yes, this exists). It even had shredded cheddar cheese on top. I'll repeat this. CHEDDAR CHEESE and chicken tikka. Together. WHY? To boot, the tomatoes were wilted, the chicken tikka was dryer than a popcorn fart and I would comment on the dressing but they forgot to give it to me. So, know this going in, they can't even make a salad right... and it costs over ten dollars. \n\nThe rest of the meal was a step up (how could it not be?) from the salad. The Chana Masala was average (a bit greasy) and the naan was baamb. \n\nMy advice? Grab an order or two of naan and dip it in your fave sauces at home. Better yet, find a place that makes great naan and something else to dip it in. NEXT!",negative,en

"I had looked forward to staying at this Sheraton for quite a while. It is just north of Butler University where I frequently travel, and is attached to the beautiful Fashion Mall at Keystone Crossing. The lobby and bar/restaurant area is quite well done, and the front service staff are helpful, warm and friendly. After receiving our room key and elevator card to the concierge floor where we were staying, we were excited to see our room. Sadly, the key card would not work in the elevator -- this happened four times during our stay. I had to keep riding up and down the elevator to constantly change out our key card. (This was a common complaint among patrons). I asked the front staff if this problem happens a lot, and they said ""Are you on the 12th floor? Then yes."" OK, you'd think this is the one floor you wouldn't want to inconvenience your guests. The key also malfunctioned to open our room causing more trips up and down the elevator. Another problem was the signage in the hotel is small and misplaced. Try finding your way around the hotel or to the mall. It's like being in a maze. Get signage that makes sense! On the plus side, the bed was very comfy, thank goodness, since I was exhausted from trying to find my way around. The hospitality breakfast was also very good. Although the front staff did a good job diffusing the angry customers whose key card would not work, I would have appreciated a manager stepping in and recognizing my inconvenience -- perhaps by comping the over-the-top wi-fi fee. Next trip to Indy, I'll stay elsewhere.",negative,en

"If you're faced with needing a place to stay close to MD Anderson, Carefree Inn is the one I can personally recommend. Our loved ones have needed a place to stay when they are not in MD Anderson, which has been on and off for the past year. The Carefree Inn is especially wonderful for patients due to their shuttle to and from appointments. It is the personal touch that sets this hotel apart from the others, because they get to know the families and anticipates their needs. They have been wonderful to our family, when we could not be there to help.
This past week we traveled to see our tag team warriors that are battling cancer with all them might. We got to meet the owner and each staff members that we've heard so much about. Each staff member was polite and smiling, welcoming us to the hotel. We loved the open kitchen that's provided for families away from their own home. Fresh fruits and waffles was my choice while we stayed the week. Each day all we had to do was let the office know when our loved one was out for exercise or appointment, the room would be cleaned and spirits would be alittle lighter. If you have time to check out this hotel, it's worth it. We appreciate them taking such care of our loved ones while their so far away. We will stay there again sometime, because the warm and caring atmosphere they provide to each guest.",positive,en

"I stayed at this hotel for one night in November 2012, for business. This was my first time staying at a Drury hotel, and this is now my favorite hotel chain.
The location is directly off the freeway. I was only there one day, and I didn’t see any restaurants or other business within walking distance. The entire staff was very friendly and professional, and seemed to really care that we enjoyed our stay. I saw the manager working the evening happy hour, and then again helping out with the breakfast the next morning. He was always courteous and genuinely seemed to want to make sure the guest had a good stay.
The property is very well maintained, and had a very nice open air lobby. It reminded by of staying at an Embassy Suites type hotel. I liked everything about his hotel. The hotel had a pool, jacuzzi, a semi-private computer room with 2 stations and a printer, small gym, and a small mini-mart next to the front desk. They also served hot popcorn in the lobby every night. The parking is free.
The stay also included one of the best hotel breakfasts I have ever had. It included scrambled eggs, sausage, potatoes, biscuits and gravy, a waffle maker, breads, pastries, cereals, juices, milk, and fruit. Everything was hot, delicious, and fresh. I was really impressed with the breakfast.
Just as nice was the free dinner!!! The night I was there the buffet included pasta and meatballs, hot dogs, a salad bar, baked potatoes, nachos, and lots of other extras. Again all of the food was hot, and fresh. The free dinner was a nice extra that I have never seen before at a Marriot/Hilton/Wyndham type hotel. The dinner is served from 5:30 - 7pm.
Also from 5:30 - 7pm is a free drink reception. When you check in you get a punch card good for 3 drinks each night. You can choose beer, wine, or cocktails. I didn’t like the whole punch card thing, but the free drinks were another nice extra amenity for the guest.
The room was well decorated and maintained. It was a medium size room with a desk, refrigerator, microwave, medium size flat screen television with HBO, but no PPV. The bed and pillows were very comfortable. The room also had free wifi, with a good strong signal.
The bathroom was a little on the small side, but very clean and well maintained. It had a granite sink and shower.
I love the fact that this hotel gives you so much, and doesn’t nickle and dime you like other hotels for parking, wifi, gym, etc. In my future travels, I will check first to see if there is a Drury Hotel in the city, they will always be my first choice.
I strongly recommend this hotel to family and friends. This is a great hotel, especially if you have children. I’m looking forward to my next Drury Hotel visit.",positive,en

إن ما يميز قصة حي بن يقظان. التي كتبها الأديب والطبيب والفيلسوف الأندلسي. أبو بكر محمد بن طفيل،. في اعتماد الفكرة، الابتكار في البناء الفني، البراعة في المعالجة، والفعالية في الإيحاء.. القصة. إن ولادة حي بن يقظان يبقى لغزا، ومع ذلك فإن الرواية السائدة تقول أن حي بن يقظان قد ولد تولدا جسديا مألوفا من أم هي شقيقة ملك إحدى الجزر الهندية، ومن أب هو قريب لها اسمه يقظان، كانت شقيقة الملك قد تزوجته خفية عن شقيقها الذي منعها من الزواج، وعندما وضعت المرأة طفلها خشيت من نقمة شقيقها الملك، فوضعت الطفل في تابوت وألقته في البحر. حملت الأمواج التابوت حتى ألقته على ساحل جزيرة مجاورة هي جزيرة الواقواق.. وصادف أن مرت في المكان الذي استقر فيه التابوت ظبية كانت تبحث عن ابنها الذي فقدته فسمعت صوت بكاء الطفل فاتجهت نحوه، وكان أن عثرت على حي الوليد فأرضعته وحضنته.. يكبر حي بن يقظان وتمر حياته في سبع مراحل.. أما الأولى فهي إرضاع الظبية لحي وحضانتها ورعايتها له حتى جيل سبع سنوات.. ثم بعد ذلك وفاة الظبية وتشريحها من قبل حي لمعرفة سبب الوفاة، وهنا بدأت تتكون عند حي المعرفة عن طريق الحواس والتجربة.. أما المرحلة الثالثة فكانت في اكتشاف النار.. المرحلة الرابعة فكانت في تصفحه لجميع الأجسام التي كانت موجودة حوله، فكن بذلك يكتشف الوحدة والكثرة، في الجسم والروح، واكتشف تشابه الكائنات في المادة واختلافها في الصور. أما المرحلة الخامسة فكانت في اكتشاف الفاء وهذا شجعه إلى الخروج من رصده إلى معارف في العالم بقدمه وحدوثه. عند بلوغه الخامسة والثلاثين من عمره، بدأ حي مرحلته السادسة وهي الاستنتاج بعد التفكير، فتوصل إلى أن النفس منفصلة عن الجسد وفي التوق إلى واجب الوجود.. وأخيرا، يصر حي بن يقظان، في المرحلة السابعة على أن سعادته تكون في ديمومة المشاهدة لهذا الموجود الواجب الوجود ورغبته في البقاء داخل حياة رسمها هو لنفسه .مما ينبغي إضافته أيضا في بداية الدراسة هذه،. أن معنى اسم حي بن يقظان لم يكن وليد صدفة. ف حي يرمز إلى العقل الفعال أو النفس الملكية المفكرة، وهو عقل خالد حي لا يتغير ولا يهرم. و ابن يقظان هو القيوم الذي لا ينام له جفن،,neutral,ar

"After driving by this place forever, two co-workers and I finally tried it out yesterday to see how the Pink Pepper stacks up against other Thai restaraunts in town. \n\nThe first thing that we noticed right away was the very small number of people dining here (as compared to their competitors). Service was good - they were very friendly, but when we asked for a menu they immediately pushed us towards the buffet special, saying that the food on the buffet line contained the best items off of their menu. So, we went ahead and gave it a try. \n\nAfter we were done, we all pretty much came to the same conclusion - mediocre. Nothing really stood out. One of the rice dishes had some kick to it, but otherwise the food was pretty bland for Thai. The quality of the meat/chicken was so-so. \n\nIn all fairness, we did not try ordering anything off their menu, so maybe they deserve another shot there.

"Warning: These Are Pink!
This is a fantastic controller. Absolutely top notch for third party. But the main faceplate on the GB color scheme is slightly pink, especially under any kind of artificial home lighting (seen under incandescent, fluorescent tubes, CFLs, and LEDs by GE). Most marketing photos don’t show it at all or at least not enough to notice before buying, so it’s pretty misleading. To be fair, it’s not visible under an LED camera flash, and is much less noticeable in direct sunlight. But once the sun goes down, you have a pink controller. I wish this had been clear in the photos and can’t believe nobody else seems to be talking about it. I’ve seen 3 of these, and it definitely got worse when production started on the Pro Plus, which has the same problem.",neutral,en

"We stayed at the Hotel Adagio for 2 nights over Labor Day, having found a great promotional rate of $99 a night through hotwire. It is very conveniently located near Union Square (great shopping and you can also hop on the trolleys there) and also only a short walk from the BART stop, which we took to and from the airport (fyi--this is very quick and easy and saves a bundle on cabs).
Though the hotel was still working a few kinks related to the renovation (e.g. humidifiers in the hallways), we could not have been more pleased with the experience given the rate we paid. They clearly spent the most money redoing the lobby/bar area, but the rooms are also very comfortable and the staff is eager to please. The lobby has a beautiful selection of coffee and teas each morning and afternoon as well as complimentary fruit as an afternoon snack.

"While on a weekend trip to Penang, we reserved a table here because of what I read on Tripadvisor. We had just come down from Dinner in the Sky before this but needed to bring my mum and daughter for dinner after. My daughter was also celebrating her birthday and I had earlier called the restaurant and spoke to Shahrul who was absolutely helpful and obliging in accommodating us. Degustation in a Malaysian-style dinner with a Peranakan/Nonya slant is unusual but it is cleverly compromised with shared plates. Very smart! Food wise, it tries to refine familiar Malaysian dishes and achieves this with a fair degree of success. The dishes were tasty, but definitely not any more tantalising than other restaurants serving similar cuisine, but because of its famous setting, prices are justifiably higher. For those comparing it to hawker food (esp. the prices), one just can't draw a parallel. It is akin to comparing apples with oranges; not fair simply because dining is also about the surroundings, service, setting, ambience etc. The appetizer Chao Tom, main dish Tamarind Beef and the desserts were particularly memorable. It is definitely a recommended visit for tourists, esp. those who have had quite a bit of street food already, due to its restored old shophouse setting which is architecturally attractive and historically interesting. Thank you to Benjamin and Shahrul who came to chat with us about the restaurant - they were most friendly and attentive. Just an amusing observation about the ""lady with the white hair"" - I note that she has had quite a number of mention here in the reviews as a haughty and rather rude person. Well, she was pottering around back and forth without giving our table any attention and not a nary of a glance from her, that is until she had to come to the table along with other waitstaff to sing Happy Birthday to my daughter.

"Ceux qui osent dire de ce film qu'il est long et ridicule n'ont vraimant rien compris et ils feraient mieux de passer leur chemin au lieu de descendre sans réel fondement un pure chef-d'oeuvre! J'ai lu le livre et vue le film, le livre est très intéressant et originale, mais Grenouille est présenté comme une sorte de monstre, un déchet de l'humanité...Ce que j'ai ressenti en voyant le film, s'est un profond attachement pour le personnage principale, présenté comme un homme doté d'un don extraordinairte et nait sous le signe du malheur.A peine est-il nait qu'il est déjà détesté de tous! L'épisode du livre avec le curé à été oublié par le réalisateur du film, ce passage permet au narrateur de nous présenté Grenouille comme une ""chose"" diabolique, c'est un point de vue très religieux puisqu'il l'associe au diable...Ce n'est pas ce que voulait le réalisateur du film, lui il montre un Grenouille très humain et même s'il y a une dimention mystique dans ce film ce n'est jamais religieux, il a était toute sa vie détesté ou pire ignoré, il a vue de la violence partout ou il allait comme si s'était quelque chose de normal, il n'a donc pas pu se forgé un sens morale, c'est pour ça que le fait de tué le rend si indifférent. Dans le livre il est uniquement amoureux du parfum, dans le film le parfum de la jeune fille aux prunes le rends amoureux d'elle, c'est totalemnet différent. Il ne faut donc pas juger le film par rapport au livre, pour une fois qu'un réalisateur s'approprie réellement une oeuvre en donnant son propre point de vue au lieu de tout simplement la mettre en image...Rien est à jeter dans ce film,les acteur sont très bon, chaque plan semble murement réfléchi. C'est totalement stupide de dire de la fin qu'elle est débile puisqu'on la retrouve dans le livre! pourquoi on critique ce film alors? Parce qu'il n'est pas fidèle au livre ou parce qu'il l'ai?

"Being a Guest @ the Clift of San Francisco gives you great first impression - nice and stylish lobby with sofas made from /decorated with ivory teeth (Is that being allowed to be imported into the U.S.?).
The room consits of cool designed interiors with added mirros - infinity style - so don´t stay in there too long you my get dizzy ;-)
They Serve Breakfast - dishes start @ around 25$ - the lame Continental Buffet is @ 30$ way to expensive - way tooooooo!
Room Service is alway plus a lot of additional charges - not just the Tip.
Valet Parking!!!
It´s a unbelivable 65,-- US$ per Night.
Valet Parking is lame - I have waited a couple of times more than 30 Minutes for my ride.
Restaurant and Bar are nice - lots of shiny people hanging out there - but as experienced - just get rid of their ""overdose"" in the lobby - honestly - we came back from a nice dinner and two guys were vomiting over the whole ""nice"" lobby - my wife will never go to the Clift again.
Go there for a drink, Party or Dinner but never think of staying there to enjoy San Francisco or a business trip.
Btw. Business - Internet access is 14,50$ thats fair - but the bandwith is maybe 28.8 Modem Century - absolutely unacceptable.
Staff is friendly - but that only helps a bit - we celebrated my birthday - and expected a little message by the management - but nothing appeared.
Sorry for this review - but be warned - we will never choose them again - there are way better options - like the ""W"" and other nice Places.

"15.12.2022, примерно в 11 20 я обратился в отделение банка по адресу г. Казань, ул. Пушкина 34а, для получения услуги аренды индивидуального банковского сейфа. Перед подписанием договора я сообщил сотруднику банка, что не желаю передавать банку мои биометрические данные и готов предоставить паспорт РФ для идентификации. На что получил отказ в оказании услуги банка от сотрудника (мне предложили воспользоваться услугами другого банка). Я обратился к человеку, на которого указали как на руководителя отделения (ФИО её не знаю, не представилась, таблички на двери кабинета не было). Руководителю отделения я сообщил, что мои права нарушаются (описал ситуацию), на что получил ответ подождать. Подождав (хотя, я не считаю, что банк в праве выдвигать какие-либо требования в таких случаях и должен незамедлительно восстанавливать мои права) некоторое время и не получив ответ (только повторный отказ в предоставлении услуги от сотрудника), вынужден был подписать согласие (считаю, что под давлением) т.к. был ограничен во времени и не хотел задерживать вторую сторону (Клиент-2) Согласно Федеральному закону от 27.07.2006 152-ФЗ, ст. 11, ч. 3 Предоставление биометрических персональных данных не может быть обязательным, за исключением случаев, предусмотренных частью 2 настоящей статьи. Оператор не вправе отказывать в обслуживании в случае отказа субъекта персональных данных предоставить биометрические персональные данные и (или) дать согласие на обработку персональных данных, если в соответствии с федеральным законом получение оператором согласия на обработку персональных данных не является обязательным. Считаю, что мои права были нарушены, банк отказал в обслуживании и обязал передать банку мои биометрические данные, хотя я многократно заявлял, что не желаю давать подобное согласие. Услуга оказвалась примерно полтора часа (за это время успел подать два обращения в банк на бумажном носителе). Прошу банк разъяснить подобный отказ и навязывание передачи биометрии. В ответе прошу не ссылаться на подзаконные акты и внутренние документы если они противоречат федеральным законам.",negative,ru
"Stayed there for only a day and a night , in transit. Overall, it was, as I said, good enough, though a little pricey for an old hotel( had a cheaper stay at Grand Residences Marriott at Lake Thaoe and it was a fantastic studio ), but then again this is SFO. The room is clean and well maintained. The corridors were narrow and the elevator was small. Bear in mind though to request a room with aircon. I was shocked that the room did not have one. Even if the weather is not hot, I wanted an aircon so I can close the windows. As a result, we kept the window open and it was so noisy outside ( cable car noise, some construction)... I think this is one of the setbacks. It has a good location though and a very good view. The reviews were so great I was a little disappointed.

"We stayed at the Drury Plaza on a recent trip to San Antonio. We absolutely loved everything about it. We had booked a standard 2 queen room through hotels.com. We received a very good rate that averaged about 120.00 a night.
Rooms--Our room was located in the older section that was once the bank building. We had a huge corner room. It had six windows and we could see most of San Antonio including the riverwalk. Although the carpet seemed to be worn, the bathroom appeared to be newly remodeled. The beds were extremely comfortable and had a pillow-top type mattress. Yes the rooms were in an older section, but in our opinion the fact that they were older and historical were what gave them character.
Location--This hotel was within 20 minutes of the airport, right on the riverwalk, and within walking distance of any location in downtown San Antonio.
Food--The free breakfast and kickback were good for what we needed them for. The breakfast kept us full until lunch and the kickback was a good appetizer for dinner.
Staff--There was not one person we encountered either in the hotel or in the city who were not polite, friendly, and helpful.
We would recommend this hotel with flying colors and will definitely stay here again on our next visit to San Antonio.",positive,en

"This movie was almost intolerable to sit through. I can get beyond the fact that it looks like it was shot with a home video camera and that this movie is supposed to span over weeks in time yet the characters do not once change outfits, but the acting broke the 4th wall to pieces for me. I've seen better acting in a 4th grade play. Aside from that the plot is unrealistic. If the man suspected the guy he would have turned him in. I was also heavily disappointed that all the killings were done with a gun what kind of gore is that. That is not a copycat the Zodiac did not kill using just a gun the authorities would have known it wasn't him. Another thing that really bothered me was that they called Disassociative Identity Disorder DSM 4 when that is the name of the book used to diagnose people with mental disorders not the name of the disorder. Overall I think this movie is not the kind of movie that could be done with a low budget at least not as low as they had or they could have made sure they had better actors or more gore. Plenty of people have went the low budget route with out having to use horrible actors look at Easy Rider that had Dennis Hopper and Jack Nicholson and a low budget.",negative,en

"Where do I begin? Walt Disney's happiest motion picture ""Lady and the Tramp"" is one of, if not possibly, my favourite in the theatrical canon of Disney animation. The sequel, however, is... to say the very least, enjoyable. I enjoyed myself throughout the whole movie. It was, (flame-shield up!) adorable! The Broadway style of the songs and the movie kind of worked, and I was humming the songs for the rest of the night. I can, if you asked me to, still sing all of the songs.But where the movie was (really) good for me, it was bad in a lot of other places. The animation was kind of scary at times. Every time there was a close up shot of someones face, I don't know... it just seemed scary to me. Also, where the hell was Lady? She gets like two lines of dialogue and only doggy hugs Scamp at the end. She gets 0% interaction with the plot and her only son!But all in all, I liked it. Compared to the original does it hold up? No. The songs aren't as good (still kind of catchy though), the plot was a lot less involved, Lady had almost nothing to do with it, and it's not as cute as the first one.

"We have lived in KL for more than 2 years now. We have pretty good idea on where to go for food since we almost eat out everyday. I heard about Maison Francaise for some time but did not get to go until recently when I needed a new place to celebrate my birthday. The restaurant is located a quiet street in the center of the city but finding the place can be a challenge if you are not familiar with KL. We ordered a bottle of red wine from Crozes-Hermitage, in northern Rhône, which was quite reasonably priced. While we just started tasting the wine, the head waiter showed up and explained to us how this ""light Burgundy wine"" is different from much stronger wines from Bordeaux because the wine is a blend of Pinot noir with another type grape. He said with such a confidence that I had to assume he truely belived it. My appertizer from scallop was pretty tastless. I had to add salt (which I never did before in a fine dining place) to have some taste. While my main dish of duck confit was OK but I had them many times in places costed less than half of the price. My partner's steak with Foie gras was the ""highlight"" of the day in that the chef used a terrible sauce that overpowered everything on the plate. To top everything off, her dessert of apple tart looked like something out of a canteen. The total damage to my wallet, almost 900 RM for two. There are plenty of restaurants in KL that you can get much better quality food at less than half the price. I definitely do not recommend Maison Francaise if you want to have true fine dinning experience.",negative,en

生々しい巧みな心情描写、木原節が炸裂した文章強く惹きつけられました！ しかし、ミーナ、罪と罰はサイコパスについての話で他の作家さんも書くことが多いテーマで木原さんである必要はないなと感じました。 消えるは、主人公の(男)が弟に向ける歪んだ愛の話で木原さんHOMEを彷彿させる内容でした。切なさ、おぞましさ、歪み、木原さんっぽいと感じさせるような内容では確実にあるのにBLとは言えない。新感覚でした。読後感も不思議な感じで、読み終わった後も余韻が残る話でした！ 虫食いは、すごく描写が生々しくて印象に残りました！とくに主人公がカエルや猫を味合うシーン。カエルの感触や猫のあたたかさが伝わってきてゾクゾクしました。それから、主人公が友達の指を舐め、欲情するシーン。友達の最後のセリフで主人公の捉え方と一般的な捉え方の違いを強く考えさせられました。ふつうとふつうじゃないは曖昧だなと。 全体的に面白く、飽きることなく読めました！ しかし、私は木原さんのBLが読みたい！木原さんのBLは他の作家さんにはない文章力と巧みさとリアルさがあります！それを感じたいと思いました！あと、長編が読みたい！",negative,ja

"UPDATE: RESPONSE TO BRIAN LEE of Chapman BMW BELOW\n With all due respect, it is out of the ordinary to push for a sale when the client explicitly states they are there to test drive a vehicle and will be test driving other vehicles prior to making any decision. After test driving the car, I told the sales person that I would need to test other cars before I know what I want. That is pretty self explanatory. What else do you need to know? Asking the same question in 10 different ways for the purpose of trying to close a deal is pathetic. I test drove cars at Audi and Mercedes. None of their sales people used these tactics. They respected the fact that I wanted to test drive other vehicles before making a decision. None of them tried to detain me or resort to these tactics.. None of them kept badgering me with the same question asked in multiple ways: \""So what is the next step\"" How likely are you to buy a car today? Tell me what you want to do next? What can we do to get you to buy today? If we offer you a great deal, would you buy this car now? What is your plan after you leave the dealership? Are you trading in or paying cash? What is it that you don't like about this car?\"" If you think that is just someone trying to \""sell cars\"" then you clearly don't understand the concept of professionalism. Obviously, we share philosophical differences. A professional does not badger a client. They provide information and then respect the client's autonomy and decision making ability. Since you seem to espouse your salesman's tactics, I will be thoroughly avoiding your dealership and will choose to go elsewhere to purchase my next BMW.",negative,en

This hotel would get 5 stars except it has the layout of a motel 6 and the location isn't the best for walking to places. If you have a car everything is close however. Overall its the best value for the money in this area. And they are still improving. I will stay here again and recommend it to any business traveler.,positive,en

This hotel needs a major renovation but due to it's size, I doubt that this happens any time soon.

The Algonquin is in a great location steps from Times Square and Madison Avenue. It's not on Broadway so it's much quieter than those hotels. It's a standard botique hotel - small rooms and vintage appointments. The hotel was clean, bathroom was updated.

The front desk staff was not attentive to my arrival. There is no club/elite lounge as typical for Marriotts. They have a coffee lounge which consists of a Keurig coffee machine in a vestibule. No mid-day snacks or refreshments. A continental breakfast was included which was adequate. I requested an upgrade and instead was placed in the room directly across the elevator.

Laundry room was very reasonably priced on the 4th floor. There was breakfast (continental) but again, very adequate with waffles, toast, boiled eggs and very good coffee!! The staff were all very friendly and helpful. We did not get to use the pool which I believe was heated but again it was all very well kept and clean. Parking was a good deal at $6 per night.
The immediate area around the hotel was extremely easy to get around, 2 hospitals right on the doorstep!!! and a 24hr CVS and an Albertsons store just a few blocks away.
. 5th and 4th Avenues which lead right down in to the Gaslamp District were right by the hotel and was only a 5-10 min drive. We will certainly return to the SS and found it very easily after arriving at 10pm on a transatlantic.....delayed flight!!. Good for you Sommerset Suites and hope to stay with you soon.",positive,en

"После введения комиссии в 200 у.е. для входящих -переводов попросил банк ПРИОСТАНОВИТЬ счета или отменить комиссию за СМС (чтобы не платить лишние деньги), так как пользоваться не собирался пару-тройку месяцев. Оператор сказала что требования уберут и со мной свяжутся по моему вопросу. Так и никто не перезвонил. Но какое мое было удивление, когда в ноябре мне понадобился мой рублевый счет, а он ЗАКРЫТ! То есть они взяли и закрыли счета без моего согласия и без уведомления! После просьбы вернуть их, сказали что это невозможно, но возможно только открыть новый счет и заного подписать документы. На мою просьбу просто открыть счет без всяких регистраций и смс ответили, что это тоже невозможно. Всегда считал Тинькоф очень хорошим и лояльным к клиентам банком, но эта ситуация меня, мягко говоря, шокировала. Если банк все таки не решит проблему, то буду видимо решать через ЦБ или другие контролирующие органы. Нельзя же просто так взять и закрыть счет без законных оснований.",negative,ru

"I went to this restaurant with my sister and mother for my sisters belated birthday lunch. The staff were pretty friendly, the decor was a bit depressing though. We livened things up with our cheery presence of course. ;-)\n \nThe food was okay, but portions were a bit small. After reading the menu I thought they were pretty reasonably priced, until I realised just how much (little) food you get.\n\nThe chowder and pan seared sea bass were ok, had to add some seasoning to the chowder though. The chips were amazing! Perfectly crispy on the outside and light and fluffy on the inside. I could have happily and easily eaten just those. In fact, the chips and the dessert were the best part. \n\nI was annoyed at one point to see other customers eating fish and chips. The annoyance was because it wasn't on the menu, and if I had known we could have ordered fish and chips, I would have! \n\nI had a gingerbread pudding with a toffee sauce and Bramley apple sorbet for dessert which was out of this world! I could have eaten several of those. hehe\n\nI almost had a heart attack when the bill came. Almost \u00a3100 for 3 people? \nWe had bread and butter, 3 mains and 3 desserts with an extra order of chips and a bowl of chowder. Apparently the Prosecco was \u00a327! If I had known I would have chosen to stop drinking on another day! \n\nSo our experience was okay. The only memorable part of the meal were the chips and the dessert, which is also the only reason I'd ever go back.",negative,en

Ein zweites Licht hat auf einmal angefangen dauerhaft zu leuchten, obwohl der Schrank geschlossen war und definitiv keine Bewegung stattfand. Dadurch war der Akku bereits nach wenigen Tagen leer. Haben dieses jetzt nochmal aufgeladen und werden beobachten, ob das wieder passiert. Die 3. Leuchte funktioniert einwandfrei und erfüllt seinen Zweck zufriedenstellend! Edit: Mittlerweile ist auch die 3. Leuchte heruntergefallen, wobei sich in diesem Fall der Klebestreifen noch am Schrank befand und die Lampe samt Magneten abgeschmiert ist. Zum Glück NOCH heile.

"What is a bit odd is that there is a Mariott Springhill Suites in the same parking lot with their sign above above the MarriottTownplace suites sign. The two are parallel in the same lot, sharing the same marque. So please be aware when you are going down the N Black Canyon highway road, a ONE WAY ROAD along the I-17, that they are in the same place. For a second we thought we were at the wrong place. I wish I snapped a photo, since we arrived after a long drive in traffic from Tucson and all three of us thought we either missed the hotel or had to go down further another drive way. If we had passed it, the turn around is a load of hassle; especially in traffic. Thank goodness for iphone GPS technology!\n\nWe booked this hotel since it was located near the Black Canyon Conference Center, and we planned to walk over; the first morning of our conference we asked the front desk how to walk over. She didn't know what we were talking about and it was immediately next door. ( You can walk through the back of the parking lot straight to it) When checking out we had trouble with the hotel charging our room, three of us stayed in a two room suite, but the staff member helping us didn't know how to split up the room charges on more than one credit card; a more seasoned person came in after 10 minutes and sorted it out, but also made a mistake; in the end running my card twice, another card three times. Fingers crossed that none of us got double charged; none of us did.\n\nThe room itself was wonderful and clean. There were two rooms each with a TV and a living room with a pull out sofa bed, and a kitchen to prepare food stocked with plates, coffeemaker, toaster and the like. There was and iron and ironing board, so all our needs were met and it was across the parking lot from the Black Canyon Conference Center. So over all I'd be happy to return.",neutral,en
"Stayed at the Fairfield Inn & Suites by Marriott New York Manhattan / Times Square over the 4 July period in NYC. The hotel is great as it is located in walking distance to Times Square, next to the central bus station and close to the central subway system.
The rooms are cleaned to a high standard, have a tv, radio, however there is no fridge in the room, no biggie as you can walk to many convinence stores/ restaurants/ bars which are very close to the hotel. There is a pharmacy/supermarket very close to hotel as well. And a pizza place at the end of the street with $1- for a big slice of pizza.
Hotel has a gym, free breakfast, which has a wide selection of hot and cold foods , fruits, coffee, cerials etc (get there early to secure a table - especially in peak travel periods), nice foyer area, roof top nightclub/ bar - free entry for guests (countered by overpriced drinks) and has a great view of the city, in basement: vending machines and an ice machine. The hotel has free wifi + free computers + printer to use in foyer area with fast internet access. The hotel also has parking at an adjacent property around US$27- per day, call in advance to book your parking.
The staff in the hotel are all very friendly and the concierge is very knowlegeble of NYC and tours available.
The hotel is a bit over my budget but I was sharing with friends, so I paid less and was ok. If this hotel is in your budjet I would definitely recommend it. Hope this review helps :)",positive,en

They'll bend over backward to make your stay enjoyable. The pool was awesome and they had the lounge chair covers that slip over the top - only the best! The pool staff was so kind to bring us ice cold waters, we didn't even have to ask!\nThe best part of our trip...since I knew we had a 8pm flight we decided to play golf nearby. And with the heat there was no way I was going on a plane stanky. I kindly asked the front desk if we'd be able to come back & use their spa facility to freshen up even after we checked out. I've never known a hotel to extend a checkout past 2 hours. I'm sure they did this as an exception, but they allowed us to keep our room until 5:30pm! It takes 1 great experience to make it memorable. \n\nI've done 2 offsite meetings here and attended one of them. From what I remember everything was executed flawlessly. Their catering was perfect - great food and nice presentation. Rooms are beyond what one could ask for. Their meeting rooms, spa, pool, tennis courts, and workout facility is beyond excellent.

"Penelope Spheeris (of ""Wayne's World"" fame) made her mark with the documentary ""The Decline of Western Civilization"", about the LA punk scene in the late '70s and early '80s. Most of the documentary features interviews with the punks and footage of concerts (which often turn violent). Overall, we get to see how the punk movement was a reaction to the hippies: whereas the hippies were into being natural, the punks wanted to have themselves as altered as possible, what with spiked hair and all. But also, we see how they're really disaffected and sometimes becoming skinheads.Anyway, this is a really great time capsule. We're not really sure whether we want to long for that era or feel repulsed by it. But this is definitely not a documentary that will leave you neutral. Truly worth seeing.",positive,en

Here is why I'm a fan: LOCATION.\n\nFrom where I live, getting to Sprouts is a pain in the ass asis A.J.'s. The Basha's closest me is not always the best stocked. And if I have to go to Fry's at The Camelback Colonnade (or anywhere at the Colonnade) I want to kill myself.....and others.\n\nDitto for Target at Christown. So why I love this Fry's is that there is ample parking, not a lot of traffic in the lot or in the market. This means that I can barrel down the aisles pushing the Cart of Death at 50 miles an hour with NO ONE IN MY WAY!!!!! I am in and out in no time. And because of the home section, I can avoid having to make two trips and pick up some items here that are not offered at regular supermarkets.\n\nI REALLY want to support local grocers but when I'm pressed for time to hell with it.

Probably because I grew up in Glendale, which is filled with boring suburbs of cookie cutter homes surrounded by six foot concrete security gates that house dysfunctional 2.5 kiddo families and promote a sense of community as deep as a valley girl's vocabulary.\n\nSo any time we visited cutesy pootsy downtown Glendale it was a memorable experience.\n\nI've toured the factory multiple times and regardless of age, childlike glee paints the face of every person in the tour group. You'll be thrilled by chocolate rivers, marshmallow clouds, edible buttercups and small orange creatures with violent green hair and a penchant for bursting into songs that have afterschool special messages tacked onto the end. Well not really, but it's as close to Willy Wonka as you're getting here in the Valley.\n\nFree tours on the half hour and sampling to your heart's content! Try the rectangular green ones. They're mint truffles and arguably the best I've had. Eat it Andes!! But I'm biased. I grew up with Cerreta. I stole their individually wrapped chocolates from the bins at Bashas. I went to high school with their daughter Candy--who's as sweet as her namesake. I'm a die hard fan of these home grown chocolatiers, and there isn't any other place I'd rather go to rekindle a bit of childhood nostalgia.\n\nIt's good family fun, a great date idea, or a nice distraction for the babysitters/aunties/grandmas out there (cuz you'll want to give the kids back right after they o'd on sugar).\n\nYou do get an unlabeled grab bag when you purchase a mixture of chocolates, but just channel the ingenuity of the young.

"My business partner and I stayed at this hotel in March. I think the hotel is fine but lacks any form of true customer service. We traveled on business and only stayed on day. We were going to arrive late and just wanted to head to our rooms and order some room service then go to bed. Prior to our arrival I called the hotel and asked if we could cancel due to the lack of food and beverage service past 9pm, we were told absolutely not & if we cancelled we would loose our deposit. We are both in the travel industry and understand the need for procedures & policies but expected that the hotel could either understand our predicament and make an exception or provide some alternate suggestions. The only feedback we received was no..no..no, when asked if we could talk to a manager Elana (I think that was her name) replied I am the manager and that was that. If the Edgewater continues to treat guests this way I'm sure they will suffer the consequences.

"*Can anybody tell me WHERE is the COMEDY ??!! *(Charlie Sheen) is a very weak comedian, (Thomas Haden Church) is looking so feeble (with him !), and the whole thing is so thickheaded ! *They tried to make a live comic book which turned out to be super bloody comic nightmare and it wasn't even funny? Like the plan's scene in the bathroom; it was so good with its cinematic imagination but there is nothing more.. except PAIN ! *Donald Sutherland ??! His relationship with his daughter ??!*This is actually a kind of work which they made it just to made it and earn some money from it , but it became such a crime when THIS money would be robbed from the very us whom got deceived by so low art work and an entertainment had absolutely no entertainment AT ALL !*Well, it would've been uglier if it was big production and starring Brando in his golden years with a REAL star.*The Sheen's family in here. Just be aware of that !*Anyone who found themselves admiring this movie or -God Forbid- loving it ! Then you must go directly to therapy before you become more dangerous and hurt anybody else !*(Brando) undoubtedly is a genius but the movie isn't ! And he wasn't intending to be one in here after reading this for sure !! But the main big problem is that no one else ever worked in this thing trying, or wanting, to be a small time smart or even good !!! (Sorry I'm crying now ! The movie's torturing is unbelievable !). *There is a scene where (Brando) hitting (Mira Sorvino) by her shoes ! That was so realistic !? Maybe he was seeing himself in her so he was punishing himself for being in such a crap ! *For the milliard time : This one could've been better (or less worse !). The script, till the train's heist, was nice and I just imagined that they'd escape to have some chase like it's another (Smokey and the Bandit) but with (Brando) as the sheriff. In fact any of those chimeras was much merciful than what I've watched !*Why this masterpiece didn't receive any Razzie award ?! You want to make me believe that there was lower movie than THIS ? I do not think so ! It's a situation where the Razzie's supervisor must himself win one for his negligence !!*Martin Sheen is here also as a guest star maybe for supporting his failure son but ironically the father was as failure as his son ! and why is that ?! Well ! Because I hate Martin Sheen maybe more than I hate comic movies weren't as good as its ambition ! *It's not a comedy movie, NO.. It's a horror one !, and I just hate horror movies especially those which have been propagandized as comic ones ! *Name good thing about it? Hmmm ! Well, this one compared to another Marlon Brando's monster movie (The Island of Dr. Moreau - 1996) would be close to (Casablanca) !!

"We go to Kobe Sushi quite often because of their 50% off sushi menu (I think its during the evenings during the week after 5 PM and all day Sat. and Sun.). We normally spend about 30 bucks here and are able to get like 3 specialty rolls and a beef teriyaki.\n\nTheir beef teriyaki is pretty good. You can tell that the meat they use is a pretty good quality steak. It's a pretty decent portion for one person too (so me and the boyfriend always end up splitting since we normally get a few rolls on the side). Its only like 7 bucks on the 50% off menu too. I like.\n\nMy favorite roll here is the \""Wet Dreams\"" roll (oh yea, one thing about this place - the names of the rolls are pretty funny [or awkward - depends on how you look at it]). Anyway, it has shrimp tempura, tuna on top, and bunch of mayo-y sauce - just the way I like it. I also recommend the Tiger Roll - basically shrimp tempura roll with spicy tuna on top. It tasted fresh.\n\nThe service is always friendly and quick. One time a waiter gave us the Wet Dream roll on the house (and that was the time it became my favorite roll). Another time we went though, the waitress got like half our order incorrect. I'd say most of the time it's a hit, once in awhile you might get a miss.\n\nThe place is pretty big and has a nice atmosphere in my opinion.\n\nWhen we're in the mood for a quick Japanese meal, we like going here. I wouldn't say it's the BEST sushi... but definitely solid and well priced. I always recommend this place to people.",neutral,en

"I recently stayed at the Omni Parker House while in Boston for a medical conference. I loved the historic value of the hotel - the lobby is stunning and Parker's bar is dark and snug, just as it was 100 years ago. The rooms are small but this is to be expected in any historic building, and it really is in the middle of everything, just a block from the T stop at Government Center. Unfortunately the facade of the hotel was covered in scaffolding which did detract from the ambiance. The staff was very courteous and helpful. However, I am glad I had a discount from the conference - my rather small, plain room normally went for $400/night which I would consider over the top - after all, you just walk through a lobby, not stay in it for any length of time. If you have the means (especially to get one of the executive suites) and want the experience, this is a great hotel. If you are on any sort of budget or wish to have large rooms with spacious bathrooms, this may not be the spot for you.",negative,en
"Oh, brother. The only reason this very irritating film avoids getting the total ""bomb"" from me is because it's at least historically noteworthy as the first Three Stooges film (when they weren't yet on their own and were still saddled with that painfully unfunny Ted Healy). But even as a longtime Stooges fan I'd have to say that young Moe, Larry and Curly are badly used here as three zany assistant janitors to Mr. Healy's taller boss janitor. They're not featured steadily through the movie and their silly on-and-off-again stints paint them more like zany overactive cartoon characters trying too hard to be amusing.Most of this toothache deals with Jack Pearl seeking in vain to get some chuckles from the audience himself as a man who impersonates Baron Munchausen (here's a good example of the level of humor: ""I object!"" ""On what grounds?"" ""Coffee grounds!""). His sidekick is none other than a young Jimmy Durante, but even the schnoz himself is a bore.",negative,en

"I visited Schwartz probably between 5-10 times within the past 4-5 years. In older times, my experience would be summarized with dry-tasteless meat and dry bread. After so many disappointments, I finally had a nice smoked meat sandwich last time. I wouldn't go there if my guest didn't insist. I won't go there again unless: a friend visits Montreal and insists of going to Schwartz because you cannot visit and leave Montreal without visiting Schwartz, because there is a line of people in front of the restaurant and so many people cannot fail to appreciate a good restaurant. \n \nLet me try to explain how I see this place. Schwartz reminds me of a hybrid of two types of restaurant.. My hometown for example, is famous for its kebabs. There are kebab restaurants in town that are old & historic and available in tourism books as recommended restaurants.. However locals don`t really to these restaurants. The common sense says that these restaurants generally lack the food quality but compensate it with their historical values. So you generally end up paying for the general experience but not for tasty good. A gastronomical disappointment in general. Locals go to other restaurants for better food experience. A second kind of restaurant is where everyone goes, where it is always crowded, a place that is talk of the town.. And every client who frequent that restaurant knows that there are better restaurants in the same city. They go to that restaurant because it is \""hip\"" and \""popular\"". Eventually, people move on and they find a new hip restaurant in the city. Just like a pop song, eventually that \""hip\"" restaurant becomes old fashioned, thrash and not worth a visit.. \n\nSchwartz reminds me a combination of these two types of restaurants. Yes, it is a historic restaurant.. However, historic restaurants have a certain quality to them. I once took a good look at the drinking glasses at Schwartz. I don't want to know how old they are. You must all have heard about news about people's unexpected generosities on Internet. Like that waitress who got 1000$ tip for a 20$ meal, or that guy who spent 500$ at a coffee shop to give away free coffees to people. If I had the resources to perform such generosities, I'd spend a grand and give a thousand brand new drinking glasses to Schwartz. They need brand new stuff in their shop. Same thing goes for the overall hygiene of the place. I think \""a restaurant having character\"" does not mean \""a dirty, chaotic, run-down place\"". Well, as long as Montrealers have a common belief that the older, the dirtier, the sketchier it is, the more character it has, I don't expect it any kind of change in this place.. You can drink from a 30 year old drinking glass and feel privileged for doing that so. This place needs a good deal of renovations. \n\nThis next point is something that bothered me more than the drinking glasses.. You can't pay with credit card at Schwartz. Here is my message to to the owners (or investors) of this restaurant. You people have a restaurant on St. Laurent which is frequented by so many people. You have queues in front of your store. People wait for 20-25 minutes just to get in. You are not a family-run convenience store,where profit margins are narrow, which can't afford 3.5% commission on credit card payments. What kind of logical reason do you have for not accepting credit cards? I only hope that their excuse is not \""preserving the traditions and character\"" of your restaurant. Not everyone is fool enough to believe that. I believe there is only one reason and it is that they love \""cash\"". They just want to to maximize their profits as much as they can and don't bother to offer credit card payments because there is an ending supply of clients thanks to travelling books, magazines, the promotional materials of the city and the Montrealers. You can go and visit a holiday resort in a country, where lots of Canadians would describe as \""3rd world country\"" and there is a credit card terminal.. How come a restaurant that -probably- makes millions of dollars in sale in a city like Montreal, on a street like St. Laurent doesn't have a credit card terminal.. I can't believe this.\n\nIn my last visit, I had to watch our waitress struggling when he was about to give me the change. It took a while until he prepares the change. I am not sure why.. I don't know if he really struggled with the calculations or he simply expected me to say \""that's fine, keep the change\"". I hope it is the former. \n\nI won't give this restaurant 1 star. 1-star would be too cruel. 1-star means \""hate\"". I don't hate it.. I hope they would try to make the place cleaner with better customer service. It is just a restaurant where it receives endless supply of clients and I guess they believe this is what everyone likes. They don't bother to make it better. \n\nI hope that one day a Montrealer will tell me about a restaurant where it is clean, affordable, value their customers with tasty smoked meat.",negative,en

"Was attending a convention at Jacob Javits Convention Center and booked the Hilton expecting a superior stay. Was disappointed.
First room was across the hallway from the elevator shafts. I shut the door to my room and heard ""whooo, whooo"" through the ceiling tiles as the elevators went up and down. Returned to the front desk, got no apologies, and was given another room at the end of the hall on another floor where quiet was promised.
Up 42 floors, down a VERY long hallway, opened the door, and found the room to be already occupied. Not only embarassing, but maybe even dangerous.
Down the elevator again to the front desk. Got another room, this time with a feeble apology and an offer of free breakfast. Was too tired at this point to even care. Got my third room that was mediocre at best. Fell asleep immediately, went down the next morning to check out. The front desk clerk was indifferent and never thanked me for staying, no ""have a nice day;"" actually no conversation at all.
Would not stay here again. Hilton New York really needs to work on their customer service skills. Did I mention that a glass of third-rate Chardonnay at the bar was $14.00?",positive,en

"Came here for a bachelor party weekend. Go karting is clean, sober way to keep busy during the day, especially if you're in Vegas when it's too cold to sit out at the pools all day. You do need most of your faculties on this one, so don't come in hungover, like some of our guys did.\n\nA group package (~$65 each) gives you two races; a time trial that sets your position, and a straight up race. They let you borrow a head sock so you don't sweat up the reused helmets. They let you watch a short safety video, but you're soon jumping into the seat of your own car. There isn't too much tutorial so you're pretty much learning on the fly, even if it's your first time in a go kart. They give you a few laps to roll at cruising speed before turning on your karts power. I won't go into driving tips but be mindful of the workers with the flags. If you see a blue/yellow flag, move over so that faster karts can pass you, this way you'll avoid getting slammed into on the numerous hairpin turns.\n\nOne of our guys was too aggressive in his bumping (not allowed!) and crashed under the plastic barriers, 'causing them to stop the race. He was warned, but not disqualified. He ended up with some deep scratches along his arm and hands where the barrier scraped him, so needless to say, it's not something you should be doing.\n\nLastly, the crew are pretty friendly, and if you check in on Facebook, you can get a free can of Monster energy drink!",negative,en
"I was looking for peace and quiet in the city and a place to take my very pregnant wife were we could find an escape with all the comforts of home. The Inn At St. Botolph provided everything and more that we were looking for. Located in Back Bay this Inn is unassuming in that it blends in to it's surroundings among Boston's beautiful brownstones. It's unique style of ""check in"" is a wonderful alternative to the usual front desk service of most hotels and inns. The rooms are on par with some of Boston's most luxurious hotels and if you need anything there is somebody available to take your call with a push of the button. The Inn's rooms have luxurious furnishings, a fireplace, full kitchen with all of the accessories, and a glorious bed that will make you want to never leave the room.
Boston is typically a walking city and The Inn's location is within walking distance to most everything the city has to offer. My wife and I loved the idea that we could just as easily prepare a meal for ourselves right there in our suites kitchen or travel to one of the many wonderful restaurants in the immediate area. You are also surrounded by lots of conveniences as the Inn is close to many of Boston's largest shopping centers.
I have traveled extensively for business and I wish every city had an Inn like this. For extended stays this is like having an apartment in the city waiting for your arrival. No crowded lobbies, no complex maze of a hotel to get around. The Inn At St. Botolph simply and magnificently provides a home away from home (albeit an upscale home) for the weary road traveler.
I can't say enough about this wonderful property. Whether traveling for leisure or business this Inn is a rare find and a must stay for anyone visiting the Boston area.",positive,en

"Traveling was myself and 8 year old daughter, sister-in-law and her two daughters (8 & 5). This hotel's public spaces were beautiful, and the pool area was very well kept. (So much so that I got the feeling that children in the indoor pool were merely tolerated but not appreciated.) The room was the only place that you could truly see the age on the hotel; moulding that have been painted over so much that you can notice the thickness the paint has added to them, there was even a strange little access door in our room which opened to reveal very dusty/dirty pipes. The bathroom was tiny, but nice with a granite countertop and ample shower/tub unit. The beds and linens were very comfy, and the staff was top notch.
Make sure you make it to the lobby plenty early before the ducks march! We arrived about 10 minutes ahead of time and there wasn't a place to stand anywhere along the red carpet. Also, for the kids, sometime ahead of time they choose an honorary duck master to help the ducks march...so if you're traveling with kids try to be in the right place/ask the right people for that honor.

"During our NYC trip we stayed at this hotel and the more trendier (pricier) Empire Hotel. We enjoyed this Hampton Inn way better and wished we stayed here the whole time. First of all, they let us check in at 7AM! This really made our day after we were tired from the LAX red-eye flight and a disappointing attempt at getting stand-by tixs to SNL. Major score!
In addition, this Hampton Inn offers free breakfast, free wifi, and in-room coffee. I was really impressed by the breakfast offerings. The breakfast menu consisted of hot oatmeal, a cereal bar, sausage patties, fresh waffles, bagels, different juices, fresh fruit, hard boiled eggs, scrambled eggs, and some other baked goods. The Styrofoam plates didn't bother me cause I was forewarned by previous reviews.
Our room was decent sized and had a desk, drawers, and a closet. The bathroom was pretty large with a full sized/shower tub. Didn't take advantage of the fitness room but this hotel has one. They also provide you with free toiletries too (tooth brush, shower cap, etc.)
In contrast, the Empire Hotel charges $13 for wifi, offers no free breakfast, is about double the price, and the room was smaller then this Hampton.
A couple of caveats though - I've never stayed at a Hampton Inn before and I stayed here for free. If I paid more than $200, I'd probably be more critical of this hotel.
BTW- There's no doorman so catching a cab in front of the hotel seems like a free-for-all and the baggage storage area is a little area next to the check-in desk that they rope off (its not secure).",positive,en

كتاب مقالات/خواطر باللغة العامية المصرية، الكتاب للوهلة الأولى تحس أنه كتاب تنمية بشرية متخفي، ولكن بعد ما تقرأ كذا حاجة تحس بالشبه بينك و بين الكاتب و خصوصا أنه تقريبا من نفس المرحلة العمرية وده لا يتناسب مع لهجة الناصح اللي محتاجة حد أكبر بس مش مشكلة. المهم أن الكتاب كان ممتع لدرجة كبيرة.. من المواضيع اللي عجبتني:. كل ماتش و ظروفه: وكلامه عن المجتمع المصري بصفة عامة في الكتاب عموما و الجزء ده خصوصا.. الهواية و أكل العيش: تاني مشكلة من مشاكل المجتمع المصري، أن هوايتك مينفعش تبقى وظيفتك . الأفكار البديلة: نجمة هنا عشان بيحب الأفلام الأسيوية و الكورية الجنوبية زيي بالضبط أفكاره البديلة في منها أفكار مبالغة و مجنونة و فيه منها أفكار نقدر نستفيد منها فعلا.. الخاتم اللعين: عن لعنة زواج البنت في المجتمع المصري، عجبني كتابته عن الموضوع ده. الناس الكويسة: عجبني تحليله لفكرة سؤال هو الشخص ده كويس و لا لأ؟ وخصوصا في موضوع الأديان.. الجامع من هنا .. صلوا عندنا: تفسيره و كلامه مشابه لفكرتي عن رؤية العالم للإسلام و السبب في كده .. عجبتني جدا.. أما بالنسبة لموضوع ليه نقعد في مصر؟ هل حضرتك يا أستاذ عمرو لسة محتفظ برأيك اللي كتبته في الكتاب ده لحد دلوقتي؟ هل شايف فعلا أن عقلية الشعب ممكن تتغير؟ لأن أنا عندي أسباب تعمل كتب تخليني ليه أسيب مصر.. ومش عاجبني تشبيه مثل أنك تتهان في بلدك أحسن ما تتهان برة، أنا أتهان ليه أصلا؟؟؟. لما ألاقي اللي برة مقدر الي بعمله وهنا الناس بتسفه فيه وبتتريق عليه؟,neutral,ar

"Years have past since Alex Rain (played by Olivier Gruner in the first movie) stumbled onto the horrific plot that involved replacing humans with machines however since then a war between cyborgs and humans has emerged and we lost, now a superwoman of sorts who is the daughter of Olivier Gruner's character (She also inherits only half of his minimal acting ability) which I think is the films minimal connection to the first, however when the superwoman is created she hides in 1980 while a bounty hunter from the future hunts her down in this confusing sci-fi clunker. Nemesis became a cult hit, that I can see why people liked even though I was no fan of said film. Nemesis tried very ambitiously to come up with different ideas, develop a beautiful look and provide tons of action, it almost worked. Nemesis 2 doesn't even have that ambition, it's a cheap rip off of The Terminator with a muscled female who is so low on acting ability she makes Olivier Gruner seem like a master thespian and the action sequences lack the explosive scope that was the main selling point of the original. I'll admit I was no fan of the original but it deserved a better follow up than this. The original also featured a good cast like Tim Thomerson, Cary Hiroyuki Tagawa, Thom Mathews, Brion James, Thomas Jane and yes Jackie Earle Haley this one features nobody and this time it's just a dull movie with a pretentious vibe. In fact after I saw this, it inspired to add a half star to the original.* out of 4-(Bad)",negative,en

"During the brief period between Clint Eastwood's string of spaghetti westerns and his Dirty Harry films, he and director Don Siegel teamed up to make this unusual picture. Eastwood plays an injured Union Army corporal during the Civil War who is taken in by a southern school for girls until he recovers from his wounds. It has been a while since the young women (most of which seem to be teenagers) have had a man on the premises, so they are reluctant to turn him in to the local rebel soldiers. The resulting situations are often humorous, shocking, erotic, or even downright grotesque as Eastwood slowly regains his strength and begins to brood over the establishment.The basic storyline almost sounds like the makings of a porno film. We have a masculine male suddenly surrounded by young nubile women. Most of them are sexually attracted to him. And he is more than willing to spread the love amongst them. The material never really slips down to the level of ""tasteless"", however. Eastwood, Siegel, and cinematographer Bruce Surtees are such skilled filmmakers, that the film always retains its dignity.Eastwood's John McBurney is like no other character he has ever played. McBurney is an amoral, conniving, and lustful charlatan. He knows that most of the women, even the youngest want his bod, and he lets more than one of them have a shot at him. McBurney often uses flattery to butter the women up, then uses his rugged good looks to reel them in. He is like a drunken player at a cocktail party, often hitting on different women even in the same scene! Eventually, his lustful ways cause him great agony and loss in a way you must see for yourselves. This author would not dream of revealing the specific consequences of his actions, but there is little doubt he has them coming.Eastwood gives a typically great performance. He seems to be having a blast with the role until things turn really ugly, then he turns mean and ugly. Geraldine Page is a treat as the steely B*tch who runs the school. We know she wants McBurney as much as the other girls, but with her checkered past shown to us in flashbacks, we find out that isn't all she's after! Mae Mercer as a slave belonging to the school gives a great performance, too. She obviously knows McBurney is a skunk from the beginning, and she never lets his phony charm bring her guard down. This is a character you will want to know more about after the film is over. She seems to have a greater knowledge of the world than anyone else in the film.The Beguiled did poorly in its theatrical release. Nobody was quite sure what to make of it, and some of its content no doubt raised a few eyebrows in 1971. For example, in an early scene we see Eastwood romantically kiss a 12-yr-old girl. Is he just trying to keep her quiet when the rebel soldiers get close, or is he really enjoying it? Probably both! A fantasy sequence later on even shows Clint getting it on with not only Page, but her young assistant! Truly some interesting goings on in this one. It's a good thing Eastwood became the star he did, or this one might have been long forgotten.Highly recommended. 9 of 10 stars.The Hound.",positive,en

It was allegedly supposed to SNOW later that night. (Il fait neige! See! I speak Fraunsh!) But not to worry- there are heat lamps on the patio to keep you all warm and toasty. Additionally, the view across the street is the Bellagio and the gorgeous Fountains gave us some \""teaser\"" shows. \n\nJenn had a mimosa and I had a bloody mary. Apparently there is a bloody mary bar (make your own?!) but that sounded confusing to me, so I just had them make it for me. And they did a pretty decent job! Nothing special- a pretty traditional bloody mary, but it did hit the spot. \n\nWe both opted for the corned beef hash. It was really rich and flavorful. They also provided had the option of adding mushrooms to it, which we both did. It came with giant toast and potatoes. I was not disappointed one single bit. \n\nAdditionally, we both shared some dessert. The fruit and mint plate, as well as this chocolaty thing with pecans and caramel- creme on top. Yum. \n\nThen we wandered around the beautiful Paris for awhile, poking our head into stores and trying on sunglasses and accessories. \n\nGreat great brunch spot. Come here! Sit outside!

"Saturday night I had what was easily one of the top 5 meals of my life. \n\nChuck Hughes' latest restaurant, Le Bremner, is too cool for words. \n\nFrom the moment you step down off the sidewalk and through the doorway you know this is going to be a good night. You'll find yourself instantly seduced by the combination of it's riustic decor, exposed stone walls, hardwood floors, and dim lighting with Bob Marley playing softly in the background. It's difficult to resist swaying to the music as the bartender charms you with his easy smile and deliciously tempting concoctions - we couldn't resist - and every single cocktail we ordered tasted like a potion divined by the gods themselves. I had the Strawberry Rhubarb Manhattan, and my friends had the Peach Long Island Iced Tea and the Pineapple Basil Margarita...all three were mindblowingly deliciously and well worth the $12 each. The cute bartender even divulged his secret ingredient for the syrup they use in their Long Island Ice Tea! \n\nWe had made reservations and there was a short wait for our table, but we didn't mind at all. We happily sat at the bar soaking it all in, the drinks were delicious and it was a great spot to people watch, PLUS we had a view straight into the kitchen where all the action is!\n\nOnce we were seated, our server brought us the menu. Neeless to say EVERYTHING looked delicious. \n\nWe ordered the Bacon Cheddar Focaccia, Naan Bread Pizza, Kimchee Snow Crab on Crispy Rice Cakes, Lobster Parfait, Chorizo Sausage and Lamb Meatballs, and the Asparagus with Poached Egg.\n\nThe prices on the menu items we ordered ranged between $9-$30 each, with the Bacon Cheddar Focaccia being the least expensive, and the MOST DELICIOUS, with the Lobster Parfait at the top of the price range @ $30. \n\nI'm going to list the stuff we had in my personal order of preference:\n\nThe Bacon Cheddar Foccacia was by far the group's favourite...what this place can do with simple bacon and a focaccia! Lord Have Mercy!\n\nChorizo Sausage and Lamb Meatballs - OMG! 3 huge meatballs packed with flavour and served with a thick, sweet tomato sauce...YUMM! The sweetness of the tomato was a perfect contract to the peppery/smoky flavour of the meatballs.\n\nNaan Pizza - the naan pizza changes daily and this night's offering was scallop, the scallops were perfectly cooked, and the pizza was topped with a lightly dressed arugala salad (I love arugala on my pizza)! The pizza was nice and spicy too! \n\nKimchee Crab on Crispy Rice Cakes - the Kimchee was delicious, if I'm not mistaken there was a hint of heat in this dish and it worked perfectly!\n\nAsparagus with Poached Egg - delcious, braised aparagus served with a perfectly poached egg and roasted cherry tomatoes...seriously, this who knew that something this simple could taste so heavenly.\n\nThe Lobster Parfait was probably the largest of the dishes, and it was loaded with fresh lobster, creme fraiche and caviar! The lobster was cooked perfectly with a sweet and buttery flavour.\n\nThe meal was a delicious and our six dishes were more than enough to feed us...I actually couldn't finish the last slice of naan pizza, and believe me, it was not for lack of trying. I almost shed a tear as as I witnessed my table mates cut up my last slice of naan pizza and share it between them. DAMN YOU tiny stomach!!\n\nWe had initially considered having dessert, their jelly donuts to be exact, but we're simply too full (amateurs). \n\nI want to go back! I want to drink Strawberry Rhubarb Manhattans and chow down on Bacon Cheddar Focaccia. For the record, if I'm ever asked, that would be my last meal.",positive,en

"The Eliot is a beautifully-appointed boutique hotel within about a five minute walk from the convention center, incredible restaurants of every description, and astonishing shopping. I stayed for three nights in late July and loved the place. First, let me say that if you are looking for a cheap place, this is not it. Bargain hunters look elsewhere. A hotel of this caliber is not meant to resemble in any way a Holiday Inn. On the other hand, if you don't mind spending some coin, then you will get every penny you pay for. Second, if you are looking for a view hotel, then look by the Charles. This gorgeous property is situated on a tree-lined street and is not intended to give you panoramic vistas. My room was upgraded from the standard room at no extra charge to a massive suite with a separate wet bar area, a gorgeous sitting room, and a huge bedroom with king sized bed. The room looked out on airconditioning vents and backstreet parking, but again, I was not there for the view. Everything was gorgeous, from the furniture to the robes in the closet. I had breakfast one morning at the cafe and must say that it was Denny's quality food set in a gorgeous dining room. Perhaps it was just my particular order, but even the buffet was not impressive-looking. That was my only complaint about the Eliot.",positive,en

"В 2022 году обратился в автошколу Лига Драйв. Попал на карантинные меры, обучение теории происходило через ZOOM.

Сдача экзамена 1000 рублей. Инструктора более понятно объясняли, и учили ездить именно так как в обычное время должен ездить.\n\nВ Лиге Драйв обучали на оборот.

"We scored a great deal on a room at Hotel 71 so decided to make a 3 day mini vacation out of it. The hotel is right on the other side of the river and Michigan Ave is is in walking distance. When you arrive at the hotel they have some lounge style music playing outside and very attentive doormen waiting to help or open a door for you. Check is was quick and efficient and provided us with a map. Be sure to take the correct elevator, they have express elevators to the higher floors 26+. Ice makers are NOT on every floor, only a few select floors.
Our room was clean, spacious and modern looking. We booked the basic city view king room and had plenty of room and an animal print sitting couch. The room included a Keurig single serve coffee/tea machine. (included 2 breakfast blend, 1 decaf and 1 green tea pod). The bathroom toiletries were nice, I enjoyed the orange scent of the shampoo and soap. Towel were nice, smelled fresh, shower had great pressure and steady water temps.
The wifi at the hotel is very slow, i was getting less than 500k up and down after various speed test through out the day. I finally decided to ask the front desk and they suggested I call the ""IT"" desk, I called them and they told me they throttle the bandwidth to 512k up/down. That is pretty bogus, you are staying at a business hotel and they can't even offer you a 1mb connection.

"Travelling with my 83 Years Semi disabled Mother, Booked tickets 2 months in advance & requested disabled person to aircraft assistance. Ist - Rize Flight= Checked in two hours prior to departure, Headed to the special assistance desk to be told that they had a long line of waiting which if we were to wait, we would miss our flight, The supervisor suggested for us to walk through security and catch the buggy service which was easily available, Even though this was very painful task for my older Mother, we did as we were advised only to be told at the buggy company desk which was far further from the security that their service was chargeable as they are a private company! We had no choice but to pay the EURO 10.00 to get to the gate (ONLY) NOT to the aircraft as we requested & booked two months ago! Rize - IST flight: Checked in at the business class separate lounge, I told the hopeless only agent that we booked the special assistance and needed the car lift to up to the aircraft as Mum cannot walk the stairs as the airport has no air bridge at all, She replied confirming that all was in order, When we tried to board, We were told by the SAME agent that she could not get the car lift and that we had to walk up the stairs, I asked for her manger to attend, He told me that I did not request the assistance, I had to show him the original confirmation email, then we got the car lift to the aircraft. Arrived IST, Wheelchair agent was waiting for us as we disembarked HOORAY, the agent assisted us through the jet bridge & left us by the seats at the gate claiming that another agent meant to assist us the very long way to the baggage hall – Guess what NO ONE showed up for 40 minutes and no one was available to assist!

Over all I had an ok expericence (although I would strongly advise everyone to stay well away from the rooms next to the ice machines!) but given the fact that this was a Hilton Hotel, I expected more. Perhaps too much. The hotel has everything a four star hotel is supposed to have. Just don't make the mistake of thinking you can have any of it for free. Nothing is included in the price for the room, which means you pay for breakfast, internet and also I had to pay 10 dollars to print out one(!) copy of my train ticket.

"해방촌 용산동 노아 노력하는 아이 노아 1. 백 명이 한 번 먹는 음식 보다, 한 명이 백 번 먹는 음식을 만들고 싶다 2. 해방촌 이탈리안 레스토랑인 노아의 간판이다. 식사를 하면서 사장님께 식당 이름을 왜 노아라고 지었는지 여쭤봤다. 바로 나온 대답이 노력하는 아이의 줄인 말이라고 한다 3. 노아 Noah라는 이름은 구약성경의 노아의 방주 노아를 말한다. 최근에 노아라는 이름의 레스토랑이 종종 보였는데, 2000년 초반 생의 남자아이 이름 인기 최상단에 놓아가 있는 것과 우연의 일치는 아니다. 예전에 연남동에 노아의 집이라는 레스토랑에서 꽤 맛있게 먹은 기억이 있어 해방촌 노아도 꼭 가고 싶었던 레스토랑이다. 본인이 생각했던 성경의 노아 이름은 아니지만 오히려 더 멋진 한국말 노아라는 이름의 레스토랑을... 4. 이 집의 리뷰들을 살펴보니 2014년부터 이어져 있다. 생각보다 꽤 오랜 업력을 가지고 있는 곳이다. 리뷰 속에서 이 집의 처음 모습이 보인다.아주 작은 공간에 오픈 키친, 그리고 테이블이 다닥다닥 있었을 것이다. 예약제로 운영하면서 맛있는 피 짜와 파스타, 그리고 가격 좋은 와인을 서빙하셨던 것 같다. 지금은 그 옆 공간을 함께 운영하면서 완전히 독립된 키친과 꽤 넓은 다이닝 공간을 보유한 레스토랑의 모습을 보유하고 있다. 5. 사실 메뉴나 맛 정보 없이 즉흥적으로 방문했는데, 꽤나 인상적인 요소들이 있다. 그중에 제일 재미있는 것이 셀프서비스가 많다는 것. 물과 실버웨어 이외에 소스와 피클, 그리고 신기하게도 피코 다 가요가 셀프다 셀프존은 참 예쁘게 구성이 되어 있다. 얼음 채운 박스에 예쁜 텀블러가 물병이고 병조림 통어 피클과 피코 다 가요가 정갈하게 정렬이 되어있다. 6. 주문은 기본 피자인 토마토 피자 마가리타 정도가 되겠다, 그리고 꽃게 파스타와 버섯 파스타로 부탁을 드렸다. 피차가 아주 예쁘게 나왔다. 도톰한 꼬르니쵸네에 예쁘게 부풀어 있는 차르의 모양이 좋다.사실 부풀어 터진 부분은 아쉽다 발효도 잘 됐고, 돌려가며 잘 구웠다는 증거다. 정통 나폴리탄 피자의 모습이 확연하다. 7. 피자 중심은 얇고 부드러우면서 토마토소스의 산미와 단맛이 치즈와 기가 막히게 어우러진다. 특히 산마자 노 토마토로 만든 소스를 마지막에 올린 신선함은 피자의 맛을 배가한다. 크러스트인 꼬르니쵸네도 쫄깃하면서 적절한 고소함과 짠맛이 느껴진다. 피자 정말 맛있다 8. 파스타는 가정식 느낌이 물씬 난다. 아쉽게도 버섯 파스타와 꽃게 파스타 모두 링귀니 노 해주셔서 파스타 식감이 단조로웠는데, 대단한 맛보다는 가정식으로 푸근한 맛이다. 버섯 파스타는 간장으로 맛의 포인트를 주고 마늘종으로 식감을 준 독특함에 들깨로 풍미를 돋우었다. 잘 만들었지만 조금만 덜 달면 좋겠다. 꽃게 파스타는 크림 베이스라 조금 느끼하다. 그 느끼함을 따로 주신 토마토소스로 중화시키며 먹는다. 좋은 구성이고 맛도 있지만 꽃게의 풍미가 약하고 청키한 살이 없는 부스러기 살만 있는 것도 단점이다.파스타보다 피자에 더 감흥이 산다. 9. 이 집은 토마토를 잘 쓰는 집이다 고수가 거의 느껴지지 않으면서 연한 매운맛이 잘 조화된 피코 데다 요는 꼬르니쵸네와 함께 먹으면 환상적이다. 스테이크 메뉴가 있다면 더욱 완벽한 콘디 먼츠가 됐을 것 같다. 게다가 신선하고 산뜻하면서 풍미 좋은 토마토소스는 이 집의 내공을 알려준다. 기본이 잘되어 있으니 맛이 없을 수 없다. 10. 참 좋은 레스토랑을 방문했다. 사장님의 열정도 멋지고, 음식의 품질도 훌륭하다. 잘 갖추어진 기본기를 바탕으로 적합한 메뉴와 레시피를 개량해 가면서 해방촌에서는 유명한 레스토랑으로 발전을 하고 있어 보인다. 이런 기본기와 열정이 그대로 유지되는 멋진 곳으로 발전하기를 바란다. 식당의 이름처럼 노력하는 모습이 느껴진다. 마음을 움직인 점심 식사였다 PS 식사를 현금으로 계산하면 인근 공영주차장 주차비 1시간을 지원해준다. 봉투에 담아 주시는데 봉투를 받는 느낌이 재밌다 동네 식당 응원 프로젝트",positive,ko
Booked a return flight for my partner and I to Amsterdam for a family wedding and personal holiday. London City Airport is bliss no queues just relaxing we arrived 45 minutes before our flight and had time to sit and have breakfast before our 9.25 flight. Even though the flight was only around 40 minutes in the air the flight crew still managed to give out drinks and snacks. The Avro RJ 85 was comfortable and more than suitable for the flight cabin crew were attentive and authoritative while still remaining pleasant. Cityjet is a full service airline and well worth the money. Since I was travelling in August all airlines charge summer rates (200%) but as Cityjet is not a holiday airline their fares don't change in the summer meaning they actually became competitive with Easyjet and KLM. Luggage and food is included flying from London you get to experience the world's best airport and they really do take all of the stress out of flying. Cityjet only cater for short haul business flights so offer no entertainment but on a 40 minute flight what could they do? I will definitely use them again and am recommending them to everyone!,negative,en

"3.5 stars rounded to 4 stars! Aloha Specialties Restaurant is the popular one-stop shop for local Hawaiian food when you visit Las Vegas. The restaurant is located in the California Hotel and Casino. You need to time your visit here (i.e., go early) because this place gets crowded! I always wondered why Hawaii people would rush to a Hawaii restaurant in Las Vegas. Don't we get enough local food at home? It's all about comfort food.\n\nPrices are reasonable, but the food preparation can take a while. Be sure you have some good topics to talk with your table mates about. Employees here work super hard to ensure you have a good experience.\n\nLarge Saimin Noodles: This dish was just like eating local noodles at home in Hawaii. The portions are quite large.

"I stayed at the Marriott Copley Place for two evenings in Jan. 2011. The hotel location is ideal to get around Boston. It's close to the Green and Orange lines and in a central part of town, Back Bay. It is close to many restaurants and lots of shopping.
I was a little disappointed by the amenities offered by the hotel. No robes, no bath gel, etc. My bed was extremely comfortable and the pillows and mattress were great. Our conference facilities were nice and most of the staff were excellent. We did have one conference staff member that was very rude, but that was the exception. The meeting rooms needed more frequent changes of trash and the conference restrooms needed to be checked more often to be cleaned.
Overall, the stay at the Marriott Copley was pleasant and comfortable. I would recommend staying here if you can afford it!!!",negative,en

"My recent 2 night stay at the Westin could be separated into to very different room experiences. I originally checked into the Westin for a one night stay. I was put into a great room (4005) on the 40th floor. The room was clean and very well appointed as I've come accustomed to with most Westins. Had my stay ended in that room, I would have given a 5 star rating for this hotel. However, my business meetings required me to extend my stay in NYC (not a bad thing) so I asked to extend my existing stay. The front desk staff member was great and with special permission, she was able to honor my existing rate to another night. The only hitch was that they could not keep me in the same room since it had been already assigned for another guest checking in that day. Not a big deal to me. The only request I made was to keep me on the same floor so that I can move my things with minimal effort. The wonder staff member was able to meet that request. This is where the 2 stars fell off...
I walked into the room (4037) and upon first inspection, the room look clean and we well appointed like the previous. I noticed a slight mildewy smell in the bathroom but chalked it up to maybe the room having been recently cleaned. The smell persisted during the entire stay. The A/C unit was also an issue. While it did a fine job of keeping the room at a comfortable temperature, every time the A/C unit turned off after getting to the desired temperature setting, a startling and VERY loud thud would signal the end of the heating/cooling cycle. The 3rd strike came with the remodeling project right outside my door at 7:30 to 8:00 AM in the morning. First I thought it was housekeeping being loud, but when I checked it was a couple of guys putting up new decorative pieces in the hallway. Not sure why they would start work so early in the morning since most of the guests are dealing with jet lag and would appreciate the ability to sleep in. Seems to me a project like that could be done in the late morning or afternoon when you can assume no one's sleep is being disrupted.
All in all, this is a great hotel. The hotel doesn't show that much age and is in a great location. had my experience stopped with the first night, I would have given them top ratings. Too bad the next night showed me the other side of this fine hotel.",neutral,en

"Sofia L. Vandaele, general manager of W New York Downtown, sent us an email upon reservation. “We're looking forward to your arrival,"" she wrote. The W may have a well-meaning GM, but delivering consistent service isn’t one of its strengths.
“Do you have a bell boy here?” we asked a en employee lounging by the entrance “I’m the bell boy!”, he replied, but showed no intention of helping with our luggage until we urged him to do so. The check-in process was pleasant enough, and the concierge was both congenial and chatty. This, however, can’t be said of the bar staff, our next stop. Deeply engaged in conversation when we approached them, the servers didn’t let our presence interrupt their chatting. The bar tenders didn’t seem acquainted with the menu, and couldn’t tell the ingredient of a standard cocktail it contained. And their conversation continued even as they served our drinks.
After an enjoyable night at the well-appointed yet quirkily decorated room, we attempted to check out. A humdrum event in most hotel properties, this checkout was a weary experience. It required four or five iterant revisions to our bill, a quest to recover luggage we left earlier, and then multiple phone calls to the hotel after our departure due to mysterious charges to our credit card. Before leaving, we asked to be contacted by the front desk manager. We are still waiting.",negative,en

"I went to the Oakland location of 3 guys optical last week (corner of Forbes and Atwood). I scheduled for the free eye exam and contact lense fitting (not free), and I did not need to wait at all, which is super nice. The eye doctor (Christie?) was very friendly and professional, and I got my trial contacts right away. I don't know much about eye exam fees and stuff, but for 40 dollars I got an eye exam + contact lense fitting, without having to wait or travel to some random faraway places (in Pittsburgh that is such a pain when you don't have a car), so I thought it was worth it. Plus it's really close to CMU (and UPitt) so I found it very convenient. \nI took one star off, because the frame selections weren't very big. And the good ones cost a lot, especially when you need high index lenses for your glasses. I heard there's a special that's $99 for 2 pairs of glasses, but that offer does not apply to high index lenses, only the regular thick lenses. So if your power is high, be prepared to pay more.\nOverall I had a great experience at the Oakland store, and I would definitely recommend it to students.",neutral,en

"I'm not too sure about why there are so many 5 star reviews about this place. Yep, the sandwich is decent, and is definitely worth the money, however, this is far from the best hoagie or sub I've had.\n\nI got the 20 inch Turkey sub. For 12.99 that's a phenomenal deal. You definitely get the value for your money.\n\nHowever, when you break down each of the components, the sandwich itself is just average. The turkey wasn't sliced turkey, but instead kind of like the same chopped up consistency you would find in a cheesesteak. I have no issues with that, but the turkey was a bit dry. \n\nThe bread is a very soft bread, with no crust whatsoever. I'm spoiled by the great bread from the Northeast, where it has a nice crust on the outside and very chewy on the inside. The bread here is still good, but I wouldn't call this a hoagie.\n\nAll in all, the sandwich itself is really average; it's the value that you get for your money that drives it up to 4 stars for my review.

She is so meticulous when baking the croissants that she sets the room temperature to suit the fussy dough, and on top of that the butter is imported from a special farm in France. The traditional French breakfast was just alright. The baguette was old and took some serious muscle to chew but I couldn't believe how good the raspberry jam and butter was. So good that I savored every bite of the stale baguette.

"This is my favorite hotel in Boston. It deserves ever star I can give it. The staff is courteous and friendly. The atmosphere is not stuffy in the least. It's warm, gracious and welcoming, from the friendly doormen to the concierge to the front desk clerks to the bellmen. The rooms are beautifully appointed, comfortable and spacious -- plenty of room to work. I love the water views and they are mesmerizing.
It's an easy walk to the North End for Italian food or an easy and quick cab ride to other parts of the city. For me, the waterfront is also a big, big plus. The Meritage Restaurant is as good as it gets.

Our bill came to $51 +tip so kinda pricey but we did have a beer each.\nThere was a strong language barrier between us and the waiter we kinda felt like we were on a customer service call and we had been patched over to Indian and couldn't quite get on the same page. the rest of the people that worked there were nice and helpful but I don't think we will make the drive out again as we live in Arrowhead .",negative,en

However, our main complaint is with the night manager and the hotel's claim to be ""pet friendly"". My husband and I booked this hotel because it allows pets. We had an evening event and there was a problem with my dog while we were away. The frontdesk received a complaint at 10pm from another guest that my (7lb)dog was barking. The hotel called my husbands cell at 10:15 to alert us to the problem. I was back in our hotel room by 10:25 to attend to my barking dog. I was then called by the night manager to inform me I would be charged $100 due to my pet disturbing another guest. The night manager, was very unprofessional in handling this. He would not rationally discuss the situation nor acknowledge the fact we reacted immediately (within 10 minutes) and took care of the situation. My complaint is not with the $100 it is with the way the situation was handled. Be weary of this staff.....they are not professional.",negative,en

"Perhaps Disney was hoping for another Mary Poppins but this is a very different story and while Angela is delightful she was a very different performer to the great Julie Andrews. Having said that Lansbury is perfectly cast and delivers a magical performance. There is something deliciously dotty about her character and she is given wonderful support by David Tomlinson. Tomilinson can carry a tune but he is certainly not much chop as a singer. It does not matter he was such a gifted actor you hardly notice. There are some great cameos from much loved stars of another time like Roddy McDowel who gives a winning performance and the much loved Tessie OShea who does very little but its nice to see the old gal again. Its also lovely to see Sam Jaffe and the king of English television Bruce Forsythe in small roles. The score has a couple of beautiful songs especially The briny sea and The age of Not Believing. The big number Portabello Road is stretched to the limit but it has plenty of theatricality. The effects look a bit cliché today but the scene with the German invaders being attacked by the wildest army in film is pretty impressive. The kids are not as annoying as other movies but one does struggle to understand what the youngest boy is saying. I loved the marching song of the home army. The home guard were very important to Britain and this is a warm tribute. The animation is delightful, much better than Pixar which I find grotesque.

"We liked it but probably not enough to come back. \n\nWe got El Presidente, which is a green chili and carne Asada burrito. It was spicy and a good flavor, but I wasn't loving the carne asada texture. And although the flavor was pretty good, it needed pico or guacamole or something to give you a break from the spice and the flavor. \n\nThe carnitas burrito was better, and the carnitas texture was great. Love that. But again, it needed something to mix it up a bit. It was just meat and spice. \n\nNext we got the green chile tamale. That was very good. But usually tamales aren't enough alone for me to love a place. \n\nReally what Espo's needs is a salsa bar with limes, different kinds of salsas, but especially some pico. \n\nFinally, the folks at the counter were nice.

"I don't typically write reviews like this, but I'm so torn about how I feel that this may help me to organize my thoughts.\nAmbiance/Decor- 2/5. The decor was just alright, more like a food court or a very nice fast food restaurant rather than a celebrity chef restaurant.\nService- 4/5. Our server checked on us throughout our meal several times and was quite pleasant. She initially put in the order for the wrong burger but came out right away and apologized. The correct burger was a bit delayed, but we were prepared thanks to her quick catch and explanation.\nFood- Here's where things get dicey... I guess I'll go with 3/5\nWe started with the \""un-fried\"" mozzarella. I did not really like this. It was not at all what we were expecting. It essentially was toasted bread with a tomato and mozzarella dipping sauce. The bread was burned in many places, and the sauce was mostly tomato. \nThe fries... Not good. I'd have preferred fast-food fries, to be honest. Thin cut, salty, not remarkable, and not good.\n However, I really enjoyed my \""Morning After\"" burger. The flavor of the meat was great, as was the egg on top. I also really liked the mushrooms. The only downside was that I wish there were just a tiny bit more sauce on it, as it got a bit dry as I ate it. The bread was soft and delicious as well. \nNutella shake- pretty yummy! It was thick, creamy, and had Nutella sauce and little crumbles on top. They also gave us a shaker of the \""overflow\"", so there was plenty to share.\n\nOne other note- there is another B&B Restaurant inside the Venetian, which made things confusing. This one is located near the sportsbook.",negative,en

"My wife and I have stayed at many JW Marriott hotels in varied destinations. We've stayed at the Cherry Creek (Denver) location three times and have been consistently disappointed in that particular JW. For instance, during this last four night visit, an unidentified VIP was arriving and the hotel staff locked out the elevators of floors 8-12. We were on the 8th floor and weren't notified that our room key was to be required to take the elevator to our floor. At our inconvenience, we had to have our card keys reprogrammed to allow access to our floor. After three attempts, the front desk staff couldn't get it right and we couldn't get functional keys made for hours. We were staying in one of the premier, mountain view rooms, but were treated like second class security risks due to the unnamed VIP. Hey, if you don't want my non-famous business, say so up front. We also arrived to find the previous occupant's dirty laundry in one of the drawers...nice! On day two, a housekeeper who didn't understand our native English allowed us to enter our room without checking for an ID or a room key. My wife retrieved her iPad but she could have easily been a thief. Sorry service and poor customer service. Shameful for the JW line.",neutral,en
"Wonderful experience at W San Francisco again! This is one of my favorite W Hotels in the World, from the service, room conditions and the designed all utilize the space well.
Lobby - Last time when I visited the hotel it was still under renovation, now it is completely different, added more elements of local SF theme into it while it still looks very cool and modern. The SF downtown sculpture and the refreshing strawberry lemonade at the check in made my wait very enjoyable. They also added a new restaurant called Trace, which focuses on local sustainable foods.
Gym & Pool - still in very good condition after all these years. Its nice to have a nice jacuzzi pool within the hotel (and indoor) that opens late for guests. Talking about the sore legs after all day of walking!
Room - This time I received the high floor corner room (Fabulous Cool Corner) which is obviously, at the corner of the hotel facing the park. It is more quiet and have a bit more space. I love the couch area by the window, perfect to sit there enjoy my day a bit while surfing online. The room is still in very good condition with Asian (Chinese) theme in it. Wonderful Beds, Great Shower Pressure and fluffy towels. Sheets are crisp as well. The buddha lamp is cute but if you find it annoying you can actually turn off at night. TVs are full of HD channels too. I love the ipod stereo next to my bed so I can rock my favorite music in it.
Service - I had great service overall. From pre arrival arrangements, check in, house keeping and the Acura experience. I had no issues at all. Thanks so much for all the people that works there.
The only thing that I wish they can bring back is the turn down service. That will make my stay even better.

"During this stay I was attending a conference at USC and location wise, this is the best part of the hotel, and I am pretty sure the hotel knows this. My room was 144.00 a night which for me is fine for a 4 star hotel, however this property struggles on a few levels. As you have likely read, the elevator had serious issues. The two days I was there, only one elevator worked and with 12 or so floors, you get the idea...waiting.
Check-in was smooth and fast though it seemed the front desk staff was busy with something other than helping guest. I called to get assistance with the sleep system beds on a few occasions and the desk staff do not seemed to be trained in how to explain how the bed works to guest. They were helpful but...OK. The concierge was very helpful when I needed directions. I had restful sleep so the beds were good and strong shower pressure, a plus.

"We've eaten at Chipotle several times before, but never at this location. And never again at this location. The entree items we got were just fine. The chips were cold, but that is far from the problem. \n\nThe issue was the 20-something man who appeared to be the shift manager. First, he was wearing Man-dex. Yes, that's what I said. Spandex. And they were cropped to boot. Somehow, I don't think they were a uniform option. Then, as he weirdly danced around the dining area, doing what, I don't know (certainly not wiping off the filthy tables), a vision came to me of Jame Gumb. I'll give you all a minute to shudder. Then there was also the patronizing and borderline racist interactions with his largely Hispanic staff. He loudly announced to us that he had just learned the Spanish word for \""turkey.\"" Then he turned to the man making our food, said the word, and then made a turkey sound. Yes, he gobble-gobbled at the poor man. He did this again and again. It was clear that the staff was embarrassed. \n\nMy husband and I were flabbergasted.

The other 3 had beers and are non-spicy eaters. I had Thai tea and asked for the spicy goodness on the side since we ordered all dishes a \""1 of 10\""\n\nWe ordered: \nBeef Massaman Curry (rich, stewy and somewhat sweet sauce, tender beef, potatoes and peanuts with steamed rice) - melt in your mouth, very flavorful\nPineapple Fried Rice with shrimp - tasty, garnished with cucumbers\nChicken Pad See Euw - with Chinese broccoli (we were offered American but turned it down) - very tasty (and good with the hot pepper powder!)\nAngel Duck - duck with black mushrooms, broccoli, green onions, baby corn, zucchini\n\nThis was a smorgasbord of varied flavors and dishes....curry, rice, noodles, and duck/veggies. My faves were the curry and the noodles. I have a feeling my leftover pineapple rice will be amazing as a second-day dish. The table polished off the noodles and duck fast!\n\nService was mostly attentive - we had 2 alternating waiters so when I asked one for something and he didn't come, I asked the other, but he didn't come back, so we asked again...but the original waiter refilled water glasses regularly just in time (Eric R. is a thirsty guy and the glasses were small), and the food definitely came out hot and as the dishes were ready.\n\nFor vegetarians/vegans, Komol has a completely separate menu for you and it is huge. I highly recommend this place (this was my second visit and the first was just as good) and I prefer it over Lotus or Pin Kaow, and most other Thai restaurants in town have been below expectations.",neutral,en

"What an incredible meal I just had last night at Tuck Shop! \n\nAfter a long wait to finally try this place out, I managed to snag a table for four just a couple of days before we wanted to come by. \n\nFor starters, the team at this resto is probably one of the friendliest, most hospitable I've found in Montreal! The service was perfect: approachable but professional.\n\nTaking a look at the one-page menu I spotted starter items like beef tartare (a must), market salad, fresh burrata, cured salmon with homemade tzatziki, crispy pork belly, just to name a few. Reading over the mains: Rib Eye steak, Ricotta Gnocchi, Duck Magret, Arctic Char, Hanger Steak, all served with fresh, seasonal sides -- a very tough decision! \n\nOur group decided to start with the Beef Tartare, Cured Salmon, and Crispy Pork Belly. Boy, did we clean off the plates! The beef tartare is served with a type of celeriac slaw and matchstick fries with aioli. Incredibly delicious! The salmon was oh-so delicate, served with paper-thin crisps and veggies, and the homemade tzatziki was just right. The Pork Belly (an obvious hit at the table) was out of this world! A cube of perfectly crisped pork belly served in a creamy morel sauce -- a dish that will remain in your memory.\n\nOn to the mains. Dishes ordered around the table included a 16oz Rib Eye steak, the Duck Magret, and Arctic Char. As I couldn't decide which main to order since it all sounded incredible, I let our waitress surprise me. \n\nThe Rib Eye was a beautiful cut, cooked to perfection (medium), and served on a creamy bed of mashed potatoes with a side of grilled Quebec Asparagus. I'm not a big meat lover but this dish was perfect! I could not say anything less about the duck that my friend ordered. It was served with a sort of fresh, citrus salad which balanced out the gaminess of the duck amazingly. Also, cooked to perfection. My first time actually trying arctic char, and definitely not the last, this dish was not lacking in taste. My surprise dish was their homemade Ricotta Gnocchi served with a very hearty vegetarian \""bolognese\"" sauce consisting of carrots, mushrooms, etc. -- meat was not missed on this dish! The portion was spot on as gnocchi tends to be very filling. Fresh shaved parmesan was a great addition.\n\nOf course, a meal this flawless must include dessert -- especially if said dessert is homemade by \""la maman de Theo\""! One of our party was celebrating a birthday. The waitress brought out an incredible platter of brownies, apple pie with vanilla ice cream, and a pot of (if I remember correctly) caramel cheesecake. We enjoyed these desserts with some dessert wine and porto. \n\nHonestly, this whole meal was so perfect and I'm certain that my dinner mates would agree. I cannot encourage anyone more to dine at Tuck Shop as it really is an experience -- from the service to the atmosphere to the perfect food reflective of what is in season....Go! \n\nI must add that I am a big fan of creative cooking with ingredients that reflect local produce and seasonal ingredients. All over each of our dishes we could spot in-season asparagus and fiddleheads (or t\u00eates de violon as they are called in French) -- loved it! \n\nPlease, do yourelf and someone special a favour and go eat here if you haven't been yet. And, if you have, go again since the menu changes often! \n\n(Note: I would say that the price range is about $$ - $$$ depending on how many dishes you order & wine. For our group of four with one bottle of wine @ 44$, four starters, four mains, dessert and digestifs, the total was about 80$/person w/ tip. I would have gladly paid more than that for the meal that I had! The dishes are well-priced as is the wine list.)",positive,en

"OK, this movie seems to have been pretty well covered by earlier comments, but there are a couple of items I wish to add. The mad scientist is producing a serum from the blood of a caged animal in order to turn a man into a werewolf. If we suspend our disbelief enough to buy into that, fine. But the animal in the cage is a coyote. That would make a werecoyote. Did audiences in 1942 not know the difference between a wolf and a coyote? They're easy to tell apart. That's weak.Secondly, this movie was covered in the third episode of MST3k (on the Comedy Channel). It took Joel and the bots a number of episodes to get up to full riffing steam, and they weren't up there quite yet on this one. They DID add enough to this snoozer to keep you awake until the end, but it was not one of their better episodes.

"My 3 year old loved it. I loved it, my wife loved it. So 10 out of 10 from our family. As for violence level? Not really that violent, mostly of the slap stick variety. Nobody truly dies, no gore, no blood, no torture, so it certainly is appropriate for children, much more so than many Saturday morning cartoons.This movie really takes the idea of CG movies where it should go.First of all beautiful graphics, textures wonderfully done, with true depth, not trying to be realistic, but forming an artistic whole. The moss on the stones, the rust on metal, the reliefs on the wood and the stone, everything adds to the whole.Character modeling, unlike many contemporary CG movies, is quirky, not cute, again within an artistic whole. The faces may look less malleable than in some other movies, but the characters are more puppet-like than human-like. I think that is a good thing, it lends veracity, how strangely it may sound, it is easier to suspend your disbelief.Hair, fur, clothing, on par, at least with the likes of Pixar. Just note in the opening scenes when Lian-Chu is fighting the giant slug; Gwizdo is in front of some farmers, and all of them have detailed clothing which caused me to pause the movie just to admire it.The setting. Far beyond the likes of Cars, and even WallE. Space has been done many times, but the fantasy environs of Dragon Hunters are only comparable with some scenes in Never Ending Story and Lord of the Rings, but again it is an artistic whole, and with lots of good ideas thrown about effortlessly. Magnificent vistas like the scene in Monsters Inc. where they ride all the doorways through its storage facility, or WallE where we see the immense trash towers he made, abound in this movie, everything is grand, yet never dwelt upon; it is just the background the whole way! The interlude where they walk through the area with the fantastic falls. The Chinese wall, the islands floating in the sky. The Broccoli in the sky? That is truly where I believe CG should go, make something which takes your breath away, and do it again and again.The sound is good, the music is varied and not only epic, and thankfully without any vocals, and purely original for the movie.Animation is quite good. Lending its inspiration to cartoons, especially some good use of stretch and squeeze. Sometimes not that realistic, but the 3d models are not realistic either.Characterization is well done too. Lian-Chu the gentle and uncertain giant is gradually growing in confidence basking in the attention of little Zoé.Gwizdo the wily manager of Lian-Chu redeems himself in the end, while Zoé isn't really changed at all, but who wants that cute child to change anyway? I at least loved Lian-Chu more than any other recent character since Sulley in Monsters Inc.The internal strife in the group gets ironed out by the external pressures, just as it should in a proper fantasy story.The story is mostly reminiscent of the Never Ending Story, especially how the world brakes apart. The monsters are pretty standard fare, except the flocking one. It lacks the emotional impact of WallE, which is the really strong point of that movie, but it is a much more fun ride, and lacks the annoying musical scene replaying in the former one, and has action from the first scene. This movie is what you want to watch for a fun and exciting time.The whole movie has, as I've mentioned a whole vision, which seems to have been followed rigorously throughout.It seems, that the setting is ready for more adventures, and I for one would hope so.One side note, the French actor doing Lian-Chu sounded a bit like Jean Reno at first, but I'm happy it wasn't him, though he is one of my favorites. Nice to hear a new, to me, voice.I give it a max rating, a bit surprised at the mediocre and low ratings by some; I have tried to address some of the concerns made by two of the reviews with the lowest vote. Approach this movie as an adventure, and as a European movie, not opposed to Hollywood, but different.",positive,en
"You don't expect much from a PRC picture, and with rare exceptions--mainly from Edgar G. Ulmer and a few by Joseph H. Lewis or Lew Landers--that's exactly what you get: not much. This ""epic"" about Nazis in Africa trying to incite an Arab revolt against the British isn't much different. The script, by longtime PRC hacks Arthur St. Claire and Sherman Lowe, is trite, laughable, full of unfunny ""wisecracks"" and plot holes the size of Outer Mongolia. The direction, by longtime PRC no-budget specialist Al Herman, is semi-comatose at best. The performances, though--except for spectacularly incompetent and irritatingly hammy lead Walter Woolf King--aren't really half bad. Veteran comedian Parkyakarkus is actually the best thing about the film. He plays a guy from Brooklyn masquerading as a razor-blade salesman and brightens up the screen considerably when he shows up. He's got great comic timing, charm to spare and seems to be having a heck of a good time. Duncan Renaldo is fairly convincing as an Arab sheik--despite his Spanish accent--and veteran bad guy George J. Lewis as Renaldo's Arab rival does his usual fine job of villainy, even if he goes a bit over the top sometimes. Joan Woodbury is quite pretty and has a nice light touch, and she and Renaldo have great chemistry together, although--like the rest of the cast--she has none at all with King. H.B. Warner, whose career stretched back to the silent era, lends a shred of dignity to the low-rent proceedings, even though he blows his lines several times and, PRC being PRC, they weren't cut out. There's a great deal of stock footage spliced in from a big-budget silent movie with a similar Arab theme--although I have no idea which one it is--and, PRC being PRC, no effort was made to try to make it inconspicuous: I've seldom seen stock footage that was so blatantly obvious.""A Yank in Libya"" isn't very good, of course--well, OK, it stinks--but it would be worth a look just to see Parkyakarkus in his prime. I had heard of him and knew that he was the father of actor/director Albert Brooks and Super Dave Osborne, but had never actually seen him in anything before. It was worth watching this tenth-rate PRC ""extravaganza"" just to see him in action. Otherwise, forget it.",negative,en

We booked the Aswan-Abu Simbel excursion thinking we'd fly on an Egyptair aircraft but what we found at Aswan airport was an old DC9 of this previously unknown company called Air Memphis. The flight was ok but I wouldn't recommend the same experience to anybody. The airplane was old and smelly seats were broken no safety demonstration and fantasy names on our boarding cards. I'm an experienced flier but this was one of the worst experiences in my life don't do the same mistake and if you want to visit Abu Simbel (which is beautiful by the way) book an Egyptair flight or just forget about it.,negative,en

As a mother you are always reluctant to bring your child to a new Doctor. My 7 year old woke up with both eyes blood shot and yucky. I was able to make a same day appointment. When we arrived the staff was friendly and the office was clean. The Doctor was so kind to my daughter he made her feel very at ease. He explained what he was doing and took his time. She was very happy at the end of the appointment and so was I. It is so hard to find a doctor that is friendly to their patients and this one was a pleasure.

"Sydney to Melbourne and was impressed - great cheap ticket. As I was using auto check in kiosk at the airport a professional Tigerair check in staffer approached to assist me even though I did not need help and she put me in an exit row with extra legroom and directed me to check in counter for bag drop and instantly issued a new boarding pass. Well groomed warm professional supervisor pulled me out of line as he was free and line was busy with a family and he took me to another counter to quickly check my bags and complete check in - everyone called me by name very friendly. On Flight cabin crew were all well groomed, great uniforms - men in vests and long sleeve, women with scarves and wedding worthy hairdos - great for a low cost carrier - friendly smiles and very professional looking us in the eye and calling us by name. Flight on time - boarding was completed early. Actually liked the cloth seats - most seats are leather on low cost carriers. Liked A320 over 737 - it feels more spacious. Liked how they use front and back stairs for boarding/de-planing as it is much faster than the long slow que on other airlines which only use one door. Simple menu - but perfect for a low cost airline - you can pre order bigger meals too. Low cost terminal at Melbourne is brand new - simple and slick - very efficient - what more can you want for the price. Airline has massively improved since problems a few years ago.",positive,en

"There are some movies that are loved by almost everyone who you come across and yet happen to be box-office failures. Andaz Apna Apna, an intelligent and hilarious comedy falls in that catogory. For once, an Indian director has kept in mind the sensibilities of the audience, and not churned out a Kader Khan type stereo-typical hoax. The movie is about two guys who dream of riches, and try to accomplish that by wooing a millionaire's daughter. A humorous drama unfolds while a lot of complexities surface in the story. The complexities add to the sheer comedy of the entire plot. Aamir Khan plays the a street-smart guy, while Salman Khan gives an unexpectedly good performance as the dumb guy. The villian played by Paresh Rawal,and his henchmen, Junior Ajit and ""Kaliaa"" make you laugh in your sleep. Although the movie borrows from a lot of other movies, despite shoddy camerawork, and despite being ""loud"" at times, it remains one of the scarce ""funny"" movies Bombay has come up with after movies like Padosan, Golmal and other Amol Plaekar movies. It is sad that it didn't do well at the box-office, for that means producers turn back to formulas and creativity is abandoned.",positive,en

"Ordered an iPhone 8 plus new contract using the online option to be delivered to my chosen store. Soon after I received an email to confirm. Received 'phone call to confirm the order and checks to ensure I was happy with everything etc and that an offer was available of an extra 5 gb of data, which I accepted. 15 minutes later another 'phone call stating that a mistake had been made and I would not get the extra. Then I receive an email saying my order had been cancelled because I hadn't collected within the time scale. So I had to ring back to sort out. The next morning I get an email from the courier indicating that the delivery was coming to me, not the store, the expected time and even the drivers name. Only by checking the tracking number which shows where the vehicle is in relation to me did I realise that my order was on the way to the store. On collection I was only required to give my name and within minutes I had a new phone. No identification was asked for, which surprised me. The phone by the way is brilliant, much faster than my previous one with fantastic features and looks. Does everything as expected. Very pleased with it.

"There are a great many LAX options, and all serve one purpose: convenience for those late-night/early-morning flights.
This hotel is no different really. It is convenient, and it will not impress you particularly with anything else.
1. The room will be small-but-serviceable.
2. The toilet paper holder may come off the wall just like any cheap hotel.
3. The sheets, pillow and duvet will be nice.
4. The tepid breakfast buffet will be $16.
5. The ""updated"" decor will not impress you, though it will be clean.
6. The shuttle bus will take you to another hotel before it takes you to yours in the middle of the night when you're exhausted after flying 6 hours.
7. If you open your window, you'll be able to hear the nice lady at Budget Rental Car talking over the loudspeaker at all hours.
8. You will get free internet.
9. You won't be able to park for free.
10. You can walk to Budget or Avis quite easily.
11. You collect SPG points.
So weighing all that:
If a clean, convenient room is ALL you want, pay less for a comparable LAX hotel. One, perhaps, that has a dedicated shuttle, directly to and from the hotel to LAX, and free breakfast.
BUT MY SUGGESTION is to spend the extra 20-40 bucks and get a nicer hotel. There are many of them right there. Hell, you're there for ONE exhausted night. Get a great rest in a comfortable room, with a service staff that gives attention to details.",neutral,en

"I stayed at the Hyatt for a week in April 06, and I have to say it was a mostly negative experience.\n\nThe good:\n1) Location. You are above a mall/underground walkways that can take you to the conference center, and many other locations. You can easily walk to old Montreal. There's a grocery store and food court in the mall that's right downstairs (well, two elevators away!)\n\n2) Water pressure. You can't see yourself in the dark washroom, but the hot water has lots of pressure.\n\n3) Soaps (when you get them) are not bad quality - not the best, but certainly usable.\n\nThe bad:\n1) Housekeeping. They don't refill empty shampoo, conditioner, etc etc. I am staying here a week, and went a couple days without roomservice, and only took down the \""do not disturb\"" sign when I needed refills, as I'm in and out of the room for a conference. So I'm completely out of shampoo and the bottles are left empty in an obvious place - and they don't refill anything. I had to call for refills. They also don't replace toilet rolls, or the tea/coffee in your room. As I'm paying $200 per night, bit annoyed not having tea/coffee in the morning... I phoned and an hour later someone arrived with some items.\n\nAlso, the fitted sheet issue others mention here -- so true. I cannot believe that they use a flat sheet on the beds. Woken up every morning on a bare mattress - ew.\n\nOther things were tidied up at least.\n\n2) Room Service. Costly room service menu, limited hours. I guess I'm used to the Hilton that's open really late (the only reason I order room service is when I need to eat odd hours due to conventions!). But the price - huge price tag on the food, and then they tack on $3 service fee and taxes on top.\n\nAlso, service was LATE both times -- they said they would bring my food at a certain time and were late by at least 10 minutes each time. (Not bad, but when you're on a schedule for meetings, it can throw things off.)\n\nALSO - they advertise \""freshly squeezed orange juice\"" on the menu (at $5), which is worse than Tropicana. It's seriously generic-brand concentrate grade. Stay away, or set your expectations low.\n\nOther than that, the people who brought the food were friendly.\n\n3) Elevators. They were out of service at times, which meant long waits. Oddly laid out too - a separate elevator takes you up from street level to the lobby. A different elevator takes you up to the rooms. A third elevator takes you down to the mall.\n\nMore inconvienent is that the stairs seem to be for emergencies only. I am on the first floor above the lobby - so I've had to take the elevator just to go down a single floor (before getting on a second eleavator to go anywhere else). Very annoying.\n\n4) Bathrooms - The lighting. Not bad if you're there for a night - but a whole week it gets on your nerves. One small light over the mirror. Oddly placed so it's awkward to put your make-up on (awkward in that you get shadows all over your face and cannot see.) That's a minor inconvienience. It's the fact that it's completely dark everywhere else in the bathroom. I guess this helps hide any grime anywhere else...\n\n5) No full-length mirror, no safe, (and naturally, no fridge). No mirror is annoying on a business trip for sure. Attending a professional workshop and conference, you want to make sure you look presentable - but it's pretty difficult as there are no full legnth mirrors anywhere to be found (in the room or halls, etc). A safe is a big one for me though - for business I have all kinds of gadgets with me I want to lock up when not in the room all day. Every other hotel I've been in over the past few years has had in-room safes - not here.\n\nFirst time I've felt the need to search out a review site to vent. I can't see returning here ever (looks like some nice smaller hotels in old montreal - think I'd consider something like that next time), and don't think I'd go to another Hyatt without some research beforehand.",negative,en

"Laut Homepage des Hotels soll man vom Holiday Inn New York City-Midtown-57th St eine einmalige Aussicht auf den legendären Central Park haben.....Ich frage mich wie das gehen soll? Ich habe zwar ein Zimmer im 9. Stock / von 18 gehabt, aber selbst von oben dem Dach aus sieht man den Park nicht sondern nur kleinere Hotels vor einem bzw, höhere vor einem. Also wegen der Aussicht bzw. wegen der Lage brauch man dieses Hotel nicht aufzusuchen.
Genau genommen brauch man dieses Hotel gar nicht zu besuchen. Es ist nicht wirklich schlecht, es hat alles was man braucht nur leider kein Flair, keine Atmosphäre, kein Wohlfühlfaktor. Es hat große (wirklich große) saubere Zimmer, mit Schreibtisch und 1 Stuhl , einem altem TV, wo wenn man nicht aufpasst schneller einen Film gekauft hat, als man lesen kann, 1 Sessel und einem guten Bett. Das Badezimmer ist etwas seltsam. Badewanne und WC sind in einem schummrigen Räumchen, davor quasi im Flur befindet sich das Waschbecken mit einer winzigen Ablage und eingebautem Fön und dem Becken gegenüber ist ein Einbauschrank der mit einem Spiegel verkleidet ist.
Also putzt man sich die Zähne oder der Mann rasiert sich nach dem Duschen, steht man im Zimmer auf dem normalen Teppich und blockiert den Weg ins Bad und an den Schrank kommt man auch nicht, so eng ist dieses Flürchen..... Ich brauche auch nicht zu beschreiben wie der Teppich an dieser Stelle aussah.... Im allgemeinen ist das Hotel in die Jahre gekommen, abgenutzt ...teilweise schon schäbig (Tapete löste sich von der Wand, teilweise eingerissen, verrostete Armaturen und was das schlimmste war Schimmel.
Der Schimmel saß leider auch in den Lamellen der Klimaanlage und war permanent zu riechen. Sowas darf selbst in einem 2 Sterne Haus nicht passieren. (siehe Bilder)
Da nützt es auch nichts, dass eine Kaffeebereiter, ein Bügelbrett und ein Bügeleisen vorhanden waren.
Zur Freundlichkeit des Personals schreibe ich nicht mehr viel, das wurde ja zu genüge getan. Die Rezeption erledigt ihre Arbeit, nicht mehr und nicht weniger. Die Kofferboys usw. sind hilfsbereit und nett, schließlich leben sie von dem Trinkgeld, was natürlich mager ausfallen würde, wenn sie nicht nett wären :-) Das Kofferaufbewahren kostet pro Koffer, wenn man um 12 das Zimmer verlassen muss und der Flug erst abends geht. Essen und Trinken ist in der Lobby beim Warten nicht erlaubt...da sie ihr teures Zeug von der Hotelbar verkaufen möchten.
Das Hotel verfügt über 597 Gästezimmer also gehen wir mal von 600 Gästen aus was wenig wäre.... Der Pool mit seinen ca. 35 Liegen auf dem Dach bietet leider nicht genügend Platz, insbesondere sind die Liegen ""vorreserviert"". Ich wollte nach einer anstrengenden Shoppingtour bei 29 Grad schnell eine Runde im Pool drehen und mich in der Sonne trocknen... doch die 3 freien Liegen waren RESERVIERT!!! Ich durfte mich in den Schatten auf die Mauer setzen! Und es kam und kam keiner für die freien Liegen...unmöglich. Ok, wär brauch schon einen Pool in NY....es wäre halt nett gewesen zur Abkühlung....der Pool schließt auch um 18 Uhr und am Abreisetag darf man sich dort auch nicht mehr aufhalten um die Zeit zu überbrücken.
Zur Lage, relativ am Ende der 57. Straße ist ein Stück zu laufen bis zur Subway. Keine besondere Aussicht, nichts besonderes in der Nähe, unspektakulär.
Solltet Ihr das Hotel billig buchen können, schlagt ruhig zu. Wie gesagt es ist sauber und große Zimmer mit guten Betten. Mehr als 100 Euro am Tag für 2 Personen sollten aber nicht ausgegeben werden.",negative,en

"This particular location helped me out of a potential issue related to closing on my Madison home; the teller, Shaun, was as professional, helpful, and friendly as they come - he's definitely an asset to Summit.\n\nGritty details:\n36 hours before I was due to close on my Madison home, the title company called me to \""remind\"" me that I needed to have a cashier's check at closing to cover the downpayment and closing costs. That was the first I had heard of needing a cashier's check... when I bought my house in AR, I just wrote a check and things were good.\n\nApparently this title company doesn't accept personal checks, which put me in a bind, because my primary bank account is still with a bank in Arkansas. There was absolutely no way I could get a cashier's check from them in less than 36 hours. Eeek!\n\nI have a savings account, a Visa credit card, and an auto loan with this Summit location, so I visited them to ask for ideas/help. They suggested using my debit card (from AR) to do a cash advance into my Summit savings account, at which point they could generate a cashier's check for me.\n\nI called my AR bank and asked them to raise the daily debit limit; they did it immediately. Summit then ran the cash advance, and presto-changeo, things were golden. Total cost? zero-point-zero! So cool.\n\nI've had nothing but great experiences here, and today continued that streak. I was truly stressed, because I stood to lose my earnest money deposit if the closing would've failed. Shaun and Summit saved the day for me. Thanks!",positive,en

"This was my first visit to the Magnolia Hotel in downtown Denver. What a gem! I've stayed at the Magnolia Hotel in Dallas, TX on several occasions prior. But this was my first time to the Denver outpost. What a gem!
I travel frequently on business and the room was beyond spacious. It was equivalent to a one-bedroom apartment in most major cities with a separate living room, galley kitchen, bedroom, and bath. Very clean, centrally located, and a nice buffet breakfast included. Starbucks is connected to the hotel if you choose to forego the breakfast buffet. The staff was courteous and helpful with restaurant recommendations. Panzano (Italian restaurant) is just a block away and was a delicious find for dinner. (recommend reservations as very busy).
Would highly recommend this hotel to others traveling to Denver for business or pleasure.",positive,en
"Ahh, the Arizona Science Center.\n\nThe MUSEUM:\nI have been here countless times since I was in elementary school, and I have to say... it was better back in the day. Not out of nostalgia or anything, although I'm sure that's part of it... But some of the cooler exhibits they used to have have been replaced with slightly less cool ones. \n\nStill, it is a nice, cool place to go on a date, especially for two nerds like us. If you are adults looking to go there, well, just don't go during the summer. The sheer number of kids will drive you nuts. Best time to go for people avoiding kids is on a weekday in the morning and during lunch, because most people are eating at the cafeteria during that time so you can have the exhibits mostly to yourself. Let loose, have fun, try out all the exhibits and feel like a kid again.\n\nThat being said, it IS a great place for kids, I remember spending hours here with my parents and school friends back in the day. You have so much fun, you don't even realize you're learning. That is the best way to learn! Everything is hands-on and if you're lucky, you might even get to be an assistant for one of the demonstrations. They don't know how cool it was back in the day, so they will LOVE it. Especially nerd juniors and whiz kids-- I know because I was one. Ha!\n\nThe FOOD:\nWell, it was better back in the day. It (the restaurant AND the menu) has gone under a major renovation since then. It has always been a bit pricey, so if you don't want to whip out your wallet for a small, greasy individual pizza and fries for twelve bucks, I recommend bringing your own lunches instead. The food is okay, if you really want to eat there for the novelty, but really nothing to write home about.\n\nThe SOUVENIR SHOP:\nYou guessed it-- it was better back in the day. It's true! There were a lot more cool science kits and tons more toys and candy to choose from, but it is still worth a visit. There are plenty of glow-in-the-dark decorations and some nifty little gift items.\n***In particular, if you love sour candy, I recommend the vials of liquid sour candy, Formula Sour--my husband is a sour candy connoisseur and this stuff gets him to tear up!\n\nOTHER:\nI highly recommend signing up for their email list- They have tons of special events throughout the year and one of them is bound to interest you. We went to the Harry Potter event on Halloween last year and had so much fun! There were special Harry Potter themed decorations and demonstrations, and you could even buy a butterbeer! Most kids were still in school, so it was a really nice time. We already know the museum like the back of our hands, so we could relax waiting for the next demonstration instead of rushing back and forth trying to see everything.\n\nI've been to the BodyWorlds exhibit 3-4 times already; I go whenever it has come around, and hope it will come here again soon! You really get to see the wonder of the human body and see firsthand how different muscles and body functions work-- I recommend more for teens and adults, as kids might be frightened by the whole body aspect. Those with easily upset stomachs will not like it either. \nIf you consider going, just remember; these are real bodies, they were real people, and many of them ARE cut open in various places to illustrate certain concepts. If that makes you feel uneasy, don't go!\n\nThe Arizona Science Center is a pretty cool place for adults looking to break the mold, GREAT for kids, and overall a nice way to spend an afternoon.",neutral,en

جميل ولكن، مع كل الاحترام والتقدير لتقييم رواد المطعم الكرام، لدي عدة ملاحظات: . المطعم حسب تقييم تريب أدفايزر هو الأفضل على مستوى المنامة وهذا ولا شك فيه اجحاف كبير في حق مطاعم أخرى. . ربما يكون أفضل مطعم ياباني في البحرين لكني أرا مستوى الأكل عنده عادي ولا يستحق كل هذه المبالغات. . جربت عنده الكالفورنيا ماكي وطبق آخر وأكاد أجزم انه ليس الأفضل في هذين الطبقين على الأقل. . طلبت حلى، ما يحضرني اسمه لكن يجي ثلاث كرات ايسكريم تحتها باستريز وكان جدا عااادي. . التصوير في المنيو جدا احترافي لدرجة انك لما تشوف الطبق في الواقع يجيك احباط. . ما وجدت مبرر عقلي واحد ان النادلات لابسات الى نص الفخذ، ليييش بس ليش؟ . أقترح انهم يلغون البار اللي فوق أو يرحلونه فوق السطح اهم شي اللي رايح يعبي الطاسة ما يمر المطعم قدام عوايل محترمة. تحياتي لكم جميعا،,neutral,ar

"We booked the room 10 months ago with the intention of watching the 4th of July fireworks. The original reservation stated my preference for a Navy Pier view. I even called them a few times the week before our arrival to beg again. Then I look online and find that you can reserve a room with just the view I wanted. Of course it cost more money. Everything in this hotel costs more money - parking? $52/day. Club level for breakfast and/or evening snacks? Another $50/day. And a note about the club - the food was good but it's NOT open in the afternoon and ALL alcohol is an ADDITIONAL charge. Not sure I drank $200 worth of Starbucks coffee or nibbled on that many carrots to make the cost worth it. You can go in there and use the computer in the morning and in the evening, but that's it. I arranged for the club as a backup in case our view didn't allow us to see the fireworks. Turns out the view from the club isn't all that great. Our room was much better. The best place seems to have been the gym though. Did I mention that costs extra too? The front desk did throw it in for free when we got the club floor, but I think it's usually another $25/day. Are you seeing a theme here?
Our room was nice. Previous commentaries were on target - it's minimalistic, the sun does stream in and immediately warm up the room. The small frig is filled with water, soda, etc. that is pressure sensitive (if it moves, you get charged). There's no space to put any food you may have and it didn't even really seem cold at all. The bed seemed to be a super-king.
I titled this ""A Mixed Bag"" because I thought it was going to be a bit more upscale given the prices listed. Lets just say that the clientele was eclectic. Very very eclectic. It's unnerving when some guests treated the lobby area like a bus station (luggage was CVS bags that they felt compelled to root through in the foyer, another individual looked like she was ""working"").
Overall, I would say that the building itself is an interesting place to stay. The staff wasn't as helpful as I would've hoped, although there were some instances of kind support.
The location is absolutely wonderful and the view of the fireworks from our room was spot on.
I guess my review comes down to this - if you can get over paying for every little thing and you are going to spend most of your time either in your room or away from the hotel, then go for it.",positive,en

"After reading the mixed reviews on Tripadvisor, I was wary of what to expect but figured the location was reason enough to book a night here plus perhaps if I booked one of the nicer rooms, the a cabana room for $489 a night, maybe it would not be as bad. I WAS WRONG. Thanks to the Roosevelt my new years was turned into a nightmare. To start with, the front desk clerks who checked us in were aloof and seemed not very bright. The room looked nothing like the picture on the website, was dark, small, and worn. There was also nothing original about the room or it's design. For a period of 2 hours the power proceeded to go in and out, which lead us to be late for where we were going. If I had known we would be in pitch darkness for so long I would have stayed at a motel 6 with the lights off and saved $450. And to summarize the staff was the rudest I have ever experienced--condescending and took no accountability for their faults/had little knowledge of the simplest things like ""where can we get some ice?"" I've stayed at plenty of hotels in LA (viceroy, chateau marmont, shutters, casa del mar, standard, beverly hilton, the W, the bel air hotel, and thompson beverly hills) but never have I been treated so poorly or as disappointed as I was with my stay at the Roosevelt.

"I think my expectations were too high when I tried out this place the past weekend with my fellow food critic, Marisa. We found it on yelp and we were encouraged by the good reviews, but it's possible that these were all written by past Chandler high grads with nostalgia in their heads. We arrived on a Saturday at two pm to avoid the school crowd and were greeted with a line and a full house. This gave us time to peruse the menu and decide on a combo plate. We both got the burrito and I got the strips and an extra taco. The strips are regular tortilla chips with cold grated cheddar cheese. Not what I expected from the reviews and not satisfying. The taco was in a hard shell that was freshly made and defintely benefited from the packet of red sauce thrown in the bag. The burrito with verde sauce was very spicy, very runny, which made it hard to eat and enjoy. The beef inside was good but I still had a hard time eating it. The girl behind the counter was very nice despite the constant interruptions for refills and more customers. She happened to be elmers daughter, so it was nice to know that we were supporting local business. Fortunately I'm not in Chandler much and have access to other local Mexican food restaraunts in phoenix.",negative,en

The rooms are large including a kitchenette, king sized bed, sofa and direct TV. Everything was clean and working. A credit to the housekeeping and maintenance staff.

Whilst Bark doesn’t vet their professionals, I have emailed them to make them aware of the fraudulent service. However, instead of further investigating or taking the fraudulent service off their site, their response was that they will not do anything as it’s the clients responsibility to vet the professionals and they will not intervene between agreements made.
This is a shame as it undermines the credibility of their website and leaves clients vulnerable to fraud.

"I booked with Hotel Indigo through a Groupon for a girls weekend getaway with some close friends. I am sure that the hotel gets quite a bit of traffic due to its location & therefore you will undoubtedly face noise complaints. Our experience staying in this hotel was less than pleasant, I am sorry to say. When I checked in the front desk clerk, a young Caucasian woman, was less than helpful & seemed as if our checking in was a nuisance. She forgot to give us our room keys & I had to ask her for them after I realized the mistake. Our first night was sleepless because of (what seemed like) drunken play in the hallway outside our room at 2:00am. When we called the front desk we were assured that it would be handled. It was not & we spent the majority of the night listening to yelling, running up & down the hall, & foul language. The following day I asked the front desk clerk (the same young lady I had dealt with when I checked in) if there was a way to rent movies and/or a DVD player for the rooms. She looked at me like I was crazy & told me no, there was no way to watch movies but to check the tv guide on channel 6. Our second & final night at the hotel was much like the first & again, when we called down to the front desk we were assured that it would be handled. No one came up to check on the complaint & the (oh so obvious) drunken behavior of the gentlemen staying on our floor until 5:30am was almost too much to take. I understand that the manager has little to no control as to the actions of others in the hotel but I was extremely displeased with our experience at Hotel Indigo. I will not be staying there again & I will advise others to forgo staying there as well.",negative,en

"Sooooo, there's a lot on my mind. The economy is in terrible condition. We're being labeled as racists, we're still mired in multiple wars, I really want the Heat to suck this year but am afraid they won't, I think I'm gaining weight, losing my hair, and I am certain that my right foot is bigger than my left.\n\nBut you know the worst thing about my life right now?\n\nNo meat. If only I was talking about the musical group, but alas. My father passed away last week so to respect Buddhist beliefs, no meat for 49 days. So what is a bacon guzzling, sausage stuffing ( shame on you for having a dirty mind!), carnivorous soul going to do?\n\nEat at Lalibela Cafe of course! \n\nWalking in, I was a little wary of the $50 authentic Ethiopian attire in a basket as you walk in. Better not be a tourist trap, I am thinking. Continuing to look around, it felt a little cluttered but not too much so, with some interesting art and more clothing on the walls to peruse. I was running a little behind on time as I had originally intended to go to Byblos which was closed for renovations until August 20th, so I cut short my examination of the decor to order. \n\nI ordered the Vegetarian Sampler (7.99), which is your choice of 3 out of 5 dishes to go along with the injera or rice. I also had the Yekemem Shai (2.50) black tea with cinnamon, cardamom & cloves cold, which was a refreshing drink. \n\nThe Masir Wat, red split lentils simmered in hot sauce and herbs, was delicious and made me not miss meat so much, with a texture reminiscent of ground beef and a spicy flavor that was subtle but satisfying. Tikil gomen, lightly spiced cabbage, carrots and potatoes was also a winner, with an almost buttery finish. Gomen, chopped collard greens cooked with garlic and onions was the only component that was merely okay, with the flavors being a little too mild for my taste, but by no means bad. The injera itself was a quiet partner in the backdrop of all these flavors, slightly sour and spongy.\n\nWhile no one checked in on my meal, no one had to, as I was quite pleased and didn't need a refill. The initial service was fast and efficient as well, even with only 2 on the waitstaff and about 15 people coming in right around when I did.\n\nSo you know what? Our economy is going to recover. I might be a little racist but who isn't? Wars are just disagreements taken too far, Lebron will remain crownless, I'm just big-boned, there's always Rogaine or a toupee, and I can always get custom shoes where the right is bigger than the left, and I have Lalibela Cafe to thank for putting me in this frame of mind.\n\nThanks for a great lunch, and I'll be back often, meat or no meat!",neutral,en

"So, having two sets of visitors coming two weekends in a row, I had the chance to visit first Stirling and then Edinburgh Castle. And you know, I am going to slightly downgrade Edinburgh. It has the advantage of being in a richly historical city that would be worth a visit even without the castle. The castle itself also deeply impressive from afar, looming up from a dramatic cliffside (of course, that was just good strategy back in the day).\n\nBut...once inside, all that big bold castley-ness doesn't quite live up to its promise. The Crown Jewels room is an interminable labyrinth of rooms with creepy mannequins. When you finally get to the crown jewels they are just meh, although the seat of destiny is pretty excellent just because of its storied past. The whole place is a bit disney-esque and commercial. \n\nA few things do stand out. The views are spectacular. St. Margaret's chapel resonates with 900 years of history. There are no fussy mannequins in there, just a real sense of place in this modest, contemplative room. And the Royal Apartments are pretty interesting.\n\nAll that being said--what are you going to do, NOT go to Edinburgh Castle? Don't be daft. Like the Blue Lagoon in Reykjavik and the Eiffel Tower in Paris, you have to visit the city's signature landmark before you can do anything else. And combined with the Princes Street Gardens, the Royal Mile, Holyood and Arthur's Seat, this does make for part of a very historical and beautiful day out.",neutral,en

"Van N from Seattle nailed it.... the only exception I'd have is that the first time I came here the cocktail service was great, the second time was okay... but certainly not horrible. \n\nOn my first visit we arrived and spoke to the hostess and were told there would be a 45 minute wait even though there were obviously many places available to sit... Okay... in most other instances, I'd have just left and not come back, but we went along with it because we had heard the place was awesome. \n\nAfter buying and finishing a drink at a bar across the street we made our way back and were seated. The cocktails were very good and our server was friendly and attentive. The decor and feel of the place is nice... it's swank but in a cool way, doesn't feel pretentious. \n\nThe second go around, I was ready to never return if we got the 'you need a reservation routine' even though there are plenty of spots available. \n\nTurns out instead we encountered the bouncer guy, who also asked if we had a reservation. We explained to him that we had friends at a table inside already seated and waiting for us... he checked our ID's and let us in without much to-do.\n\nSo the bouncer guy didn't cause a fuss, but the scene outside is what I found comical. You have this muscled bumpy dude who is standing within this velvet roped off area that is blocking the door so you can't get inside... \n\nI felt like I was trying to enter The Roxbury or something... I was waiting for Richard Grieco to walk past and enter before me as I stared star struck and envious... but instead we walked inside and the place isn't that busy. \n\nI'm not one for glitz, glamour or bullshit... and it seems like Bitter and Twisted is trying to create some illusion of exclusivity and after this last go around I've had enough. \n\nIt's a cool place and yes the drinks are pricey, but what turns me off are the games. I don't need it. It doesn't amuse me. There are other places that serve great cocktails. If I want to feel special I'll watch Mr. Rogers re-runs...",negative,en
"This was our first dining experience at VG. We were celebrating my husband's birthday and thought we would try it. I must say that although the food was very good and tastefully prepared and presented, there were some disappointing aspects to our visit. Without going into a lot of detail, when we eat at an upscale place like VG, we are fully prepared to pay their prices. No problem there. However, when we pay those prices, we don't expect to be seated next to screaming children. If we wanted to eat with screaming children, we would have gone to a fast food restaurant. People with small children need to hire a babysitter, especially on a Saturday night. If they can afford to eat at VG, they can afford to hire a babysitter. VG also needs to be aware of this issue and tactfully tell customers with small children that they cannot accommodate them. I'm sorry, this may sound heartless, but that's the way we feel.\n\nIn other areas, the food was good, no doubt about that. The ambience was a bit noisy (aside from the screaming children), no doubt due to the fact that the floors are not carpeted. I'm sure carpeting would absorb a lot of the noise. We've gone to many other restaurants at this price point and never experienced the noise level we did last night. Of course, in all fairness, it was a Saturday night. In addition, the tables are very close together causing both the staff and other patrons to unavoidably jostle my husband.\n\nOn the plus side (yes, there was a plus side), the food was very tasty and well presented. The service was adequate although we've had better service at other restaurants.\n\nAll in all, we'll have to think long and hard about returning to VG despite its \""awesome\"" reputation in Summerlin.",negative,en

"My husband and I searched online for a good deal on a nice hotel in the city for the night after our wedding. The hotel markets itself well, and we were looking forward to the complimentary evening social, sit-down check-in service, in-room spa option(s), and good location. We were let down in every category except for location.
The hotel is located in the heart of it all! A block from Howl at the Moon, 2 or so blocks from House of Blues. It's also on the other side of a FABULOUS Mexican joint, Dos Diablos (absolutely delish food), but other than that, everything was a let down. No pool, no bar, no restaurant (their ""room service"" food comes from Harry Carry's across the street), and nothing exceptional. The sit-down check-in was nice, but a little anti-climatic once you see the rest of the hotel. The rooms are large (for a downtown location), and I loved the Aveda bath products. But the evening social left much to be desired. The food was so-so, but the room that it's housed in is dark and awkwardly set up. We felt too out-of-place to even sit down and eat. Breakfast offered a nice spread, but for a Continental brekafast, I expected cold cereal - there was none. Coffee was mediocre, muffins and donuts tasted like gas station offerings.
Overall, the room was clean and the staff was friendly. However, we would not stay here again.",negative,en

"Sweets and breads from all over the world, and good coffee? Cute, amicable counter staff? Trendy neighborhood? Check, check, and check!\n\nNova's Bakery is an occasional indulgence for me-I visit when I'm loafing around Plaza Midwood and jonesing for some sweets and coffee. I LOVE tiramisu and chocolate croissants. Nova's excels in preparing both of these treats. Freshly baked and served, yum yum. I've had the coffee-real smooth. It sure ain't Folger's or other cheap battery-acid-laced substitutes and they normally have several varieties to choose from. The lattes are good as well: they use a medium roast espresso. \n\nBoth times I've been, the staff have been in a jovial mood and seemed to really want to take my order. (Maybe they could teach their skillz to other restaurants in Plaza Midwood) If you don't like sweets, they have breads from all over the world. I think its the most well-rounded (cosmopolitan? international?) selection of any bakery I've seen in town. Pumpernickel, rye, focaccia, sourdough, you name it! \n\nBe certain to load up on carbs and caffeine at Nova's if you're on Central Avenue. Nice place to bring a date after the meal or a group of friends, I'll be back soon (hopefully doing both of these).",neutral,en

"I would give this hotel a 2.5 stars if I could. The rooms are not bad given the price you pay for. However, this place is just so far from everything else. I visited over Fourth of July weekend, and it was 100+ degrees every day. Since Palace Station is not on the Strip, you can't take the bus to and from the hotel. There's no public transportation, and you'd have to take a cab every time you go out on the town. They do have free shuttle service to a shopping center (still not on the Strip, and you'll have to switch to the bus from there), but it doesn't run very often. I've learned my lesson and now know: 1, pick my vacation destination with consideration of the local weather (aka, perhaps July is not the best time to visit Vegas, particularly if you stay at a hotel that's far from everything else); and 2, choose accommodation not only based on the price (if it's far from your daily activities, sometimes you end up paying even more for transportation costs than if you just pay for a slightly costlier hotel that's more centrally located and from where you can walk to where you'll be during the day). Plus, cab fare in Vegas is ridiculously high (and I'm saying this coming from DC where the cost of living is generally high). It was definitely not worth it to be frugal with the hotel and then wind up spending more on cab fares (not to mention the time wasted). Once we decided to save the money (and not spend $50 every day on taxis, and walk back at night (thought the heat wouldn't be that bad by then) to the hotel from the intersection of the boulevard and West Sahara Avenue. I'm an avid walker who normally likes to walk, and the walk itself only took no more than 30 minutes. However, even though it was past 9pm, the temperature was still uncomfortably high, and I almost fainted on our way because of the heat and dehydration. Thankfully we made it to Landry's (the seafood restaurant across from Palace Station) shortly after I began to feel lightheaded. I believe Palace Station caters more to Vegas locals (not for tourists who usually stay in the enclave on the Strip), and we probably made the wrong decision staying there when we ignored every factor other than the price (I've learned my lesson and will take a more holistic view next time when planning trips). Nonetheless, the location was still not the thing that bugged me most (it was our fault choosing to stay there, not the hotel's, and we could've and should've done our research better prior to arriving). When we checked in on Friday night the receptionist took my debit card number and told me there will be a $16.79 service charge per night if we used the room services. We were careful not to use any service (didn't even use the wifi, watch TV, and hesitated to take the shuttle until the last day). Still, when we checked out on Monday early morning, my card was charged $50.37 for \""room service fee.\"" I noticed this on my bill but didn't have time to inquire right on the spot because our taxi was waiting outside to take us to the airport. I thought it'd be easy to just go and call to ask later. When I got back home I called them and was transferred to their account department. Even though it was during their business hours, no one answered the phone and I left a voicemail detailing my question and asking them to call me at the number I gave. I never received a call back or got a refund. I'm pretty sure they said I would be charged only if we used the services, which we didn't. It's just annoying (and I hate companies who do this) having to pay some nitty extra fees not already included in your booking. In addition, they were all along ambiguous about this \""service charge,\"" and I'm left alone wishing we had gone to a different place.",negative,en

"Petite plongée dans la vie d'un assureur malhonnête qui est en plaine crise existentielle. Un rôle parfaitement vide de sens, complètement esseulé (François Berléand) qui commence par son exigence qu'un inconnu le tue (à sa demande donc), qui se poursuit dans la salvation d'être agressé violemment dans le métro par trois jeunes puis par un séjour à l'hôpital et qui se finit en retour du goût à la vie. Certains spectateurs seront logiquement mis sur la touche. Scénario des plus noirs, à la violence mal justifiée et donc limite gratuite. Beaucoup trop de temps morts, de vides font de cette histoire quelque chose d'insipide. Edy s'oublie très vite, bien que le réalisateur ait tenté une palette d'effets de style et se soit amusé derrière sa caméra à filmer l'incohérence et le vide. Pourquoi pas quand c'est bien fait. Mais Stéphan Guérin-Tillié ne peut tout miser sur sa mise en scène tape à l'il. Il faut savoir aussi donner corps à des personnages. Le problème principal d'Edy est qu'il filme le vide certes, mais qu'il n'apporte aucune morale. C'est donc un film noir totalement désincarné. Un non-film. Une négation parfaite du cinéma. C'est à se faire plaisir ou à vomir. Une étoile pour la tentative de Guérin-Tillié, pour l'interprétation de Philippe Noiret et pour le fou rire de Marion Cotillard.",negative,fr

"Among NYC hotels, this one, along with the Time Square Hilton, are two of the very best I've stayed at. The only issue with this hotel is the check in lines, which are often very long and somehow progress slower than other hotels (much much slower). The rooms are clean, up to date, with nice furniture and housekeeping does a nice job (compared to some other NYC hotels). The noise level is suprisingly low, especially considering how booked this hotel usually is. The location is fantastic. It has a nice lounge which tends to get very busy, but is very convenient. The staff all seemed very helpful and I noted there seemed to be a high security presence monitoring the public areas.

"The day has finally come for me to witness the perpetuation of Azumi's fate as an assassin, fruition of her character and the ultimate attempt to draw me deeper into the world she rampaged through so mercilessly during the first saga.That's as poetical as I'll get when talking about Azumi 2: Death or Love, because when I cringed over the heavy sentimentality of House of Flying Daggers and complained about the credibility of Aya Ueto portraying a blood-driven assassin, after watching Azumi 2 I started to appreciate the previously mentioned shortcomings more than ever before.Not only does the determination of each assassin feels sluggish and uninspiring but also many important elements are omitted from the entire experience. In Azumi 1 we saw the assassins use various stealth tactics (which is their number one priority) as well as logic to make easy work of their marks with swift executions and quicker abilities to escape. But I won't hold that against this movie too much since the story is slightly tweaked this time around and many more obstacles are planted in Azumi's way to prevent her from reaching the warlord and displaying any signs of charisma. By the way, Chiaki is foolishly shelved for the most part of the film and is basically playing a toned down version of Go Go, minus the cool weapon and sense of menace.This brings me to the final blow which is the action, simply disguised in the title as the 'Death' side of the epic. In the first half of the film we see the debut of many promising adversaries with flashy looks and even flashier weapons. To no one's surprise they meet their end one way or another but the film falls short when each of them start dying too fast and too easily. In Azumi 1, the young assassins were mostly overpowering the opposition with quick but somewhat satisfying battles and the final showdown between Azumi and Bijomaru in comparison to the fights in Azumi 2 was at least climaxed and worthwhile. Some interesting effects were introduced but they were unable to achieve innovation due to the shortness of each encounter. I am in no way knocking down the conventional style of samurai films with their quick and realistic battles but characters in both Azumi films were so imaginative and straight out of anime that the rules could have been broken and the action should have been further enriched.The romance side of Azumi is there to fill in time between the fight scenes and unfortunately at the end it serves no purpose nor provides a much needed resolution.As a fan with an open mind for wide variety of movies and animation, I won't lie and I'll admit to my neutrality and unimpressiveness towards the first Azumi film, but I'll step right up and say that after watching Azumi 2, the original was made to look like a flawless masterpiece. For what it's worth, Azumi 2: Death or Love could have gone straight to video, with its invisibly richer budget and a failed potential to add or even expand on the bumpy journey of desperate assassins, doing their best to restore the peace, with an unwavering courage to die trying.",negative,en

蜜丝佛陀的彩妆是之前的室友介绍的，在她用的时候就发现了一个问题，有浮粉，之前给室友推荐了一款保湿霜，用了基本没太大问题。这款粉不是天天用，只是外出和有的时候脸色不好用，配合他家的粉底液，由于没有化浓妆的必要，通常都是薄薄一层。总体来说，配合40号粉底液妆容明显显白，但是基本还算比较自然，可以接受。持久度来说，早上9点化妆，中午基本明显变淡，晚上肯定就没有多少效果了，但是比起之前用美宝莲，皮肤没有不适感，不知道是不是因为每次化妆水、精华、乳、霜至少涂三层的缘故。总体来说，是一款不错的粉，大大的镜子用起来很方便，粉扑比起美宝莲的款也更好点。,positive,zh

"I've stayed at numerous hotels in multiple cities throughout the country, including New York, Boston, San Francisco, Las Vegas, and Los Angeles, but I've never encountered worse service than the Beach Haven Inn in San Diego.
Here are the facts, feel free to make your own conclusions:
1. Check-in involved an uncomfortable 20-minute interrogation with the manager about why I was in town and what I was planning on doing in the room. Even though it wasn't his business, I told him I was 'in town for the beach' and 'sleeping in the room'.
2. The hotel lacked the proper billing paperwork from Expedia. Even though they had my reservation, they messed up the billing with Expedia and threatened to charge me again for the room if they couldn't work it out (i.e. punishing me for their own incompetence). Luckily, Expedia was helpful with this and the matter eventually got resolved.
3. A friend from La Jolla showed up to hang out with us at the beach during the day, and the manager yelled at me as we walked by the office because he saw 3 people although I only booked a room for 2. Again, even though it was none of his business, I explained that our friend was just meeting us there and we were on our way to the beach. He angrily told me that we would be charged an extra person fee if my friend was in the hotel room for more than an hour (I would have enjoyed seeing where in the room agreement this policy was stated).

"This hotel, due to the staff, who are totally liers and hypocriters. We choosed this hotel because we thougt It was a safe one. We couldn´t made a worse choise! we had a reservation til Wednesday, since the staff told us plent, I mean,several times that we had prepayed and everything was set till Thursday,we beleived that. I actually called the frontdesk In order to confirm and made her even check It out on te computer again.
So after all of this, we trusted the Orchard hotels staff. When we arived to the hotel Wednesday evening, another staff told as tat we had to leave or pay for one extra night. We were so confused and ask to speak to te manager. We had a discussion and after an hour he understood the situation ant that they convinced us to stay, that´s a new agreement. We even ask him If he would like us to leave, in order to not pay for on extra night, that we didn´t choose to pay for!! He promised to forward the information till the morningstaff.
Thursdaymorning, we checked out, no problem. We left our bags in the Hotel for a couple of hours.When we got back to the Hotel, another staff,she called her self manager, told us that we had to pay!!!!??? We couldn´t believe this actually happened. After explaining one more time, made her call the first staff who told us that we had payd til Thursday, called the manager from last night, she told us, and even gave us a receipt that she didnt charge us for anything. That felt good but her behaviour was really rude.
All this cause us a really bad experience of San Francisco, we missed our night out att Wednesday night, te morning after, we didnt have time to take the Coastal road back to LA. And when I got back to Sweden I noticed that they, after all words, receipts and promises, charged us the fully amount for the room.
I have never been more fooled and see this bad behaviour before. Beyond that, the rooms are not specially good, I would say the standard Is about maximum 2,5 stars.

The kung pao was not spicy, and the cripsy orange beef is so much better at PF Changs it is pathetic. Because it was my friends birthday, they brought us ice cream with balls of kim-chee fruit. We all tasted it and were laughing about the way it looked (BALLS) of kim-chee.

"We had a lunch reservation for Friday, January 2nd at 1:30 pm, and weren't seated until 2:20! It was a disaster. When we checked in, the hostess at the counter wasn't especially helpful and mentioned that they were running 20 - 25 minutes behind schedule. In their defense, they did bring out complimentary drinks to those waiting, but there wasn't enough seating, and as someone who is 9 months pregnant, it took a LONG time for them to eventually bring out some water. Which was fine (I didn't ask for it, after all), but I thought it a little odd that they weren't more aware of the crowd that was standing around waiting.\n\nWhen we were finally seated, I wasn't overly impressed with the food. The waitress informed us that the kitchen was extremely backed up, but we told her we had a flight to catch and the food came out in a fairly timely manner. The peppers to start were a little too sweet for my taste (it tasted very citrus-y to me), and my dining companion and I did NOT like the sweet ricotta pizza (with pink peppercorns...it tasted like a spicy dessert). That being said, we both really liked the Venetian panino and would order it again.\n\nThe cookies to finish off the meal were delicious. \n\nOverall, I'm disappointed that a manager never made the rounds apologizing for the delay (like most 50-minute delays would warrant) , and that the food wasn't really worth waiting for.

"I am a hotel manager here in the Seattle area. Because of my position in the hospitality industry I view hotels a little differently than others.
Location:
The hotel is located on the wharf which is more of a touristy neighborhood. I was happy to see that the neighborhood had a ton of little shops and restaurants with-in walking distance. There is even a little beach area about two blocks away. Getting to the other neighborhoods isn't too hard - I walked to downtown a few times. From downtown you can use BART (public transit). The valet parking fee is really high $42 or $49 per night (I forget which). If you are out all day you can easily pay a couple of bucks and park on the city streets at night and then move your car before 8am in the morning - worked just fine. There is also a self park garage for $28 a block away.
The Hotel / Room:
I was worried that the design would be corny /campy. I'm not a huge fan of the nautical design. I think they did a great job making it work / not feel like a gimmick. The room itself was big (I had a deluxe) and clean. The hotel has a huge fitness room as well. Housekeepers did a great job cleaning the room. Older Tv's, but whatever. Comfortable beds, decent tub, Aveda bath products... I cannot complain! I did not hear one sound from another guest. There is a court yard that plays music until evening. If this would bother you, get a ""street view"". I didn't mind at all / it was kind of cool. (they have different musical artists just playing).
Service:
I found everyone I encountered to be friendly. I did notice there were a lot of times the valets / bellman would ignore us. I found myself greeting them out of habit (again i work at a hotel) only to get no response. There were only a few that did this as the others (you could tell) were professionals / took pride in their job. My requests were dealt with quickly. I'm pretty low key, so I didn't need much. Housekeepers did a great job and also said hello. Oxanna at the front desk was helpful. I asked to check out another room - the front desk easily and quickly handled my request.
Overall:
If you don't plan having a car and don't like walking and public transit, this is probably not the best neighborhood. If you are a first time San Fran visitor and want a nice quiet, clean place to stay, I would recommend this hotel.",positive,en

"Had I been familiar with the stage production of Guys and Dolls before seeing the movie, I might not be as fond of it as I am. Although in all fairness, I would probably still like the film production better because of my general adoration of both Brando (for his acting) and Sinatra (for his voice, although he is quite the actor as well, see The Manchurian Candidate or From Here to Eternity.)As for some of the other reviewers' statements about the songs, I have the Broadway soundtrack and though Isabel Bingley's voice outshines that of Jean Simmons, it is not more pleasant. I find it to have a rather shrill quality. Jean Simmons' voice is much more realistic, though admittedly, that is not always a huge concern in musicals. Also the only time I particularly noticed Marlon Brando's particularly weak vocal register was during his rendition of ""Luck Be A Lady"" and only there because I was previously familiar with Sinatra's version. I also find Vivian Blaine's voice to be much more pleasing in the movie than it is on Broadway. And Sinatra's voice alone would be able to redeem the failings of all the others, if they indeed were in need of redemption. (They weren't) It is infinitely better than Sam Levene's, particularly in my favorite song, 'Sue Me'. Also, the complaint that lots of songs were omitted from the movie for inferior songs, I beg to differ. 'A Bushel and a Peck' is hardly a gem and the song that replaced it, 'Pet Me Poppa"" and its accompanying performance is more Hot Box material. I personally do not care for 'Marry the Man Today' at all and rejoice that it was not included in the movie. I adore 'I've Never Been In Love Before', and though it was not sung in the movie, the instrumental version can be heard when Nathan is in Adelaide's dressing room. The song 'A Woman In Love'expresses the same sentiment equally well and probably in a range that both of the stars could more capably reach. And the movie wouldn't be the same without the song 'Adelaide', not included on Broadway. In fact, if the movie soundtrack were available for sale, I'd recommend purchasing it instead of the Broadway. Though I have not seen the original production, I cannot imagine that the acting would be superior to that of the movie's lead actors. The important fact is that the story is as charming as ever and the acting and songs do not make it any less so.",positive,en

"I've been here a couple times, and found Paradise Valley Burger to be a consistent 4-star experience.\n\nFor a burger joint, the food ranks between a 4 to 5 star. They offer a huge assortment of toppings for the burgers, chicken sandwiches and portabello mushroom sandwich. I have enjoyed the Paradise Bacon Cheeseburger, and have stolen a few bites of my dining companion's food as well. The Country Fried Burger is a decadent as it sounds- country fried, smothered in gravy with crispy fried onions- no, I didn't order it, but I sure did sneak a taste! And while I don't understand ordering a chicken sandwich at a burger joint, I did get to sample a bit of a chicken sandwich, and it was flavorful and juicy, very hot and fresh off the grill.\n\nThe sides are good as well- sweet potato tater tots were another item I personally did not order but stole a few before they quickly disappeared. \n\nService time was inconsistent, rating it a 3 to 4 star. Seems when they get a full house, output noticeably slows. If I was in a hurry to get back to an office, I might find this a dealbreaker. But maybe people coming from a work site could phone in an order so it's ready when they arrive. \n\nAlso, they have fresh brewed Iced Tea. They have a bunch of sodas in a cooler case, but since I am not a soda drinker, I cannot give you much more info on that.\n\nNow of course I COULD point out that they are making your food fresh and that does take a little more time. Well, guess I just pointed that fact out. Still, if there's one thing that PV Burger Co. might work on, it would be workflow / consistent timing of orders during particularly busy hours.\n\nCasual/comfortable indoor environment, good place to meet up w/ friends, or grab a quick bite by yourself even.

"I really dislike both Shrek films. (Since their both ""PG"" and have words in them I would never say myself, so I disliked them.)But when it comes to ""Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron,"" which I just barely watched for the first time last month, I became a fan of animated films, other than Pixar. ***Spoilers ahead*** In ""Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron,"" a horse foal is born and eventually becomes the leader of his heard. One night, he sees a strange light in the distance, and he sets off toward it. This action eventually leads to his capture, and several more things. Throughout the movie, we hear a narration. It's through the thoughts of Spirit, though the horses never talk. This is what makes the movie so goo. They (the movie makers) recored real horses to do the sounds the horses made; none of those sounds were made by humans.Spirit meets Rain, a beautiful mare, and Little Creek, a native-American, who owns Rain. Little Creek later frees Spirit and Rain, they go running home.I have never been a big fan of Brian Adams, but I intend to buy the soundtrack to this film in the near future.

Une mise en scène soignée, un scénario ambigu et inquiétant (et sans jugement), une reconstitution d'époque minutieuse. Premier film pour Lorenzo Ferro et il est absolument étonnant. Une belle révélation. A ses côtés le très sexy Chino Darín (fils de Ricardo, bon sang ne saurait mentir), lui aussi très bien. La photo est superbe, la bande-son sympathique. Beaucoup de bonnes choses donc, même s'il manque un petit quelque chose pour en faire un chef d’œuvre.

"Considering its popularity, I found this movie a huge disappointment. Maybe I was expecting too much from this film. After all, it is one of the most well known martial arts films of the 1970s, but I could never figure out why. The story is uninteresting. It is also a very talky movie with sporadic action sequences. My biggest problem with the movie was that the story does not offer a character that I could root for, since the intended hero is an idiot. Director Chang has no sense of style, and he is unable to hide the glaring imperfections found in the narrative. I know this is not supposed to be high art, but I found the movie boring.

Honestly I'm sure they are tastier at your fav dim sum spot, but it was a nice touch being able to order these along with other sushi, etc.\n\nDesserts are nice, but the drinks are even nicer. The Rouge and the Floating Orchid were both quite tasty. I'd definitely come back to Japonais to sit in the lounge and have overpriced tasty cocktails.\n\nOverall a tad pricey for what you get, but what isn't in Vegas? Out of the asian fusion places I've been to I prefer Sushi Samba, Nobu, and Tao, but I do prefer Japonais to Little Buddha.",negative,en
This is the poorest managed company I have ever dealt with. They are late constantly at pickup and drop off. I was on the first flight with three planes waiting and still a hour and half late. No notification until you get to the airport. The one flight crew lady continually slammed doors in the back of the plane the entire flight. I don’t know what she was doing because they only give out a small bottle of water. I would rather pay big prices than deal with them.,negative,en

"We had a trip Australia to Switzerland in August. We’ve never flown Singapore airlines before this, and probably would have opted for a different airline, but our trip was booked through a travel agent. But now that we have flown with Singapore Airlines I will in future definitely book any international flights with them. The seats are actually comfortable, and seem to have just a little more leg space than all the other carriers. The staff are meticulous, ground staff and in flight. Their check in process was seamless. With 3 stops on our trip ( including a short flight with another carrier) our luggage all made it to our destination,
I am thoroughly impressed with the professionalism, manner, efficiency and ease of travelling with Singapore Airlines.",positive,en

"We booked this place after reading the reviews here and it definitely is as good as everyone says.
As it was a year of big birthdays for the both of us, I cheekily requested a room with a view. Where they made no promises, they did say they'd put a note on the file and when we first looked out our 31st floor window, they had clearly made the effort for us. The hand made birthday card and cakes was also a really nice wee touch.
We woke on our first day to see the sun coming up behind the Empire State building on one side and a great view down the Hudson and Jersey on the other. It was a great start to the holiday.
The staff are exceptionally helpful and friendly and genuinely seem interested in what your experiencing on your trip. The rooms are plenty big enough and well equipped with everything you really need for a stay in a city like NYC. The beds are also really comfy, which is a must in this city too. Sleep is precious in NYC after all!!
People say the street is quite dodgy, what with the parole office a few doors along, but it's really not that bad. There are certainly dodgier streets in Manhattan.
Its in a great location to experience the city. It's in between 8th and 9th so you've got good north and south bound avenues to get taxi's. It's far enough away from Broadway mania but close enough to walk there if you need a fix.
Great location, comfortable rooms and extremely hospitable staff. This hotel is great and we'll definitely stay there again.",positive,en

The room was clean and bathroom was spotless. The bed best was one of the most comfortable hotel beds that I've ever slept in. There's also a free wine and beer reception in the lobby every night from 5-6. Oh, and this hotel does offer free wifi if you join the Kimptom club or something like that.

Hotel is being updated and we heard the workmen in the morning above our room. Didn't bother us but may others.
Yes air conditioning units taped in window to reduce draughts were a 'feature' but we loved the hotel and friendly staff.

"I've been working in Seattle off and on for quite a while and I've stayed at a lot of the 3 and 4-star hotels in the central area. Hands down, my favorite is Hotel Ändra, and I stay there a lot. From the moment you walk into the warm but modern lobby, you are greeted by friendly, professional staff and the enticing smells of garlic, salmon, and Ouzo from Lola, the adjoining restaurant.
Because the hotel was formerly an apartment building the rooms are more spacious than you would expect. I stay most often in what they call a Superia King and unlike many inner city hotels where you must inch around a king bed, the rooms at Andra are so spacious the bed is not the slightest impediment. There's even room for a couch, a coffee table and end table, a very nice work area and sometimes a wet bar. A lot of these rooms have walk-in closets and they all have super efficient and stylish bathrooms.
If you find you need room service, you get it from Tom Douglas's restaurants, the aforementioned Lola (mediterranean) or Serious Pie (foodie style wood-fired pizza). I like to get a cocktail from Lola and enjoy it in the excellent lobby or on the mezzanine. Starting last week the wi-fi is now free - you just have to ask for a code for each device you'll be using. The gym is small but pretty well-appointed and usually I have it all to myself.
As for location, it's three blocks to the downtown shopping area, six blocks to the famous Public Market, three blocks the other way to Belltown's hot bars and restaurants, one block to the classic Cinerama theater, and another block and a half to Top Pot Doughnuts. In other words, you couldn't be in a better spot.
Speaking of doughnuts, one other don't-miss at Hotel Andra are the doughnuts from Dahlia Bakery across the street. A bag of fresh hot doughnuts is shaken with cinnamon and sugar and served with whipped mascarpone and local jam. Your cardiologist recommends you at least walk across the street and get them but you can order them from room service, too.
What brings me back to this hotel time after time is the feeling that the folks who work here actually care about the guest's experience in a way that I just don't get from even the best of chain hotels. Truly a unique and satisfying place to hang your hat.",positive,en

"My flight was delayed, so it didn't make sense to check in before dinner with my favorite gal in Denver. I called the hotel to ask that they hold my room reservation because I would be checking in late. The lady begrudgingly agreed to hold my room reservation, but rudely asked, ""Well, what time are you planning to check in?"" I explained I would check in after I ate dinner, and she then snapped, ""When will that be?"" I explained it would be in about 2 hours.
In contrast to that rudeness, my late night check-in a few hours later was pleasant. But, any good feeling I had was quickly snuffed out when the elevator to get from the front desk to my room in the Tower Building was broken, and I had to drag me and bag across the street, navigate the maze of the convention area to the elevator up to my room.
The room was fine, but I note that the bedsheets looked wrinkled like someone left it sitting in the dryer for too long. The bathroom was horrible because the showerhead was broken.

"I've never really been a huge tea-drinker; I prefer the bubbly acidic taste of coffee. But I've been inclined to drink more tea (and kindly persuaded, as well), so I thought I would try a tea service. Ma Cha was the picked spot.\n\nLocated inside an old house, Ma Cha was a smaller venue, but it was laid out between two floors with enough room between tables not to crowd the guests or make you feel on top of one another's conversations. The teas available for consumption or order lined the walls, alongside various pieces of art worth looking over as you enjoy. My lady friend (the kind persuader) and I ordered the tea service for two. It included two pots of any kind of tea for each of us, various bites (cookies and sandwiches), full service, and probably something else I cannot remember. We also ordered separately (I think) a few cucumber sandwiches and a vegan-BBQ bao.\n\nAgain, I am not a tea aficionado, but I thought the leaves were lovely. I ordered a white, she ordered a green, and we shared pots. I preferred the white I had ordered--it was more subtle and balanced--but the cookies (delicious shortbread circles, tea cookies), sandwiches (refreshing and different, light), and bao (better than Wow Bao, although I enjoy their product, too) were all equally delectable. The environment was quiet and paired well with the teas, which I'm sure all have \""healing properties\"" and the like.\n\nApparently what we had was not a \""true\"" tea service, but we had tea that was served to us, so I think it was pretty similar. And similar or not, it was a nice time. I was not able to finish both pots of tea, but a full 2 pots should be enough for even the biggest tea enthusiast. Ma Cha was a pleasant find during an altogether pleasant trip to Madison.",neutral,en

"The Oxford is a beautiful and lovingly maintained historic property. The location can't be beat for any business downtown. It is within easy walking distance of shopping and excellent restaurants (the best was right across the street). A complimenary town car will take you anywhere within a 2-mile radius. I appreciated getting the tip from other TripAdvisor reviewers about the fee for parking. We did the math and realized that it was cheaper for us to take the airport shuttle and not use a car downtown, even if we had to take a cab once or twice. And it worked out great.
However, what makes the Oxford outstanding is the unparalleled service. Every single staff member we met seemed happy to serve us. There is good service and then there is cheerful good service - and we got cheerful excellent service. As just one example, the minibar from our room happened to be out for repair, and the staff promptly delivered a refrigerator to our room, since I had medication that needed to be kept cold.

I am pleasantly delighted with the flavors and textures- the chicken in the butter chicken is tender and the samosa's outer shell is firm yet flaky to hold the mildly spiced vegetables, namely potatoes and peas. I have identified that one of my guilty pleasures in the carb family is garlic naan. Man, it's good here. The dining room is bright and colorful- it backs up to the classy Bandaids club. I suppose it adds to the \""exotic ness\"" of the experience. All in all, I would love to come back and try ordering off the menu. The buffet is $8.99 on weekends and I got to try lots of wonderful things.",neutral,en
There have been some great burger places opening in the Phoenix area as of late. I would say my top 2 favorites are Aioli Burgers and Ingos tasty burgers. Both are special in their own way.

I always get the white truffle burger because who doesn't love that flavor! It was fantastic and went well with the ice cold mexican coke. I will make it a habit to visit them every Tuesday at Urban Cookies. The tradition of great food trucks continues!,positive,en

"Let me just say that it isnt all bad.
The room was very comfortable and quite new. They gave the most pillows that I had seen on our entire trip (very comfy ones too!)- about 6 on each bed!
The breakfast was excellent. Pastries, bagels, cereal etc and it all was very fresh and nice.
The problem for us was the cigarette smoke. We booked a non smoking room as we dont smoke and we have a toddler. We were shocked to find that the corridors of the hotel were smoker friendly! So the smokers were filling the halls with smoke which I could smell in our room even with a wet towel across the bottom of the door! I was appalled. We had to walk through it with my son and I am just amazed that the hotel has this policy.
When my husband spoke to the front desk regarding this they were not suprised and had heard similar complaints from other guests. However they just stated that it was hotel policy.
However NOWHERE on their website does it mention this. You would expect them to have at least one non smoking floor.
Many places we stayed were entirely non smoking.
The other downside for us was that the area seemed (like a lot of inner LA) a bit on the rough side.Its convenient for hollywood but took over 1 hour in traffic to reach Venice Beach/Santa Monica pier. Its also not convenient for the airport. Next time I would stay nearer the airport which is also nearer to the beach areas.
The hotel seemed quite secure though, there were cctv cameras on each corner of the corridor and the underground car park has a gate that can only be opened with a room key after it closes at 6pm. This is also cctv monitored. On the downside there is no room safe and to our surprise no safe at reception!
I was woken at about 3am by someone playing about with their car stereo in the outside parking and the sound of traffic is constant all night long.
Im glad we only stayed the one night but if you are a smoker and are in LA for seeing Hollywood then im sure you could do a lot worse.
Non smokers, people with young kids and those that want the beaches/airport, you could do better.",negative,en

"Zumanity the adult side of Cirque. I have seen this show three times and sat in three different sections. Helpful tip: If purchasing tickets, stay away from the lower orchestra as there are blocked views if too far back. Usually lower orchestra is considered premium seating at other venues, not in this case as is just below the low hanging balcony in which makes it difficult to view the arial acts going on up high.\n\nGreat show for couples! Is a bit risque to take your mama or daddy to so stay clear of that, could make for some uncomfortable moments, common sense...just saying. \n\nI was expecting super sexy and erotic, is more mild than that. Did not give me that tingle and jump start I had been wanting or hoping for however was a fascinating show nonetheless. \n\nCreative, comedic and tastefully erotic...such a tease",neutral,en

"I think this place is too hyped up, luckily we were able to walk right in on a Friday night without waiting. Some reviews indicate a 1 hr wait time, so I was a bit skeptical. The restaurant is cute, but very loud. You have to yell to place your order! Service is not the greatest, it's so crowded that I think it's hard for the waiters to properly attend you... You literally have to flag them down at times. As for the food:\n\nCrab Artichoke Dip - really good, with big chunks of crab! \nBBQ & Bleu Burger - felt the Bleu Cheese overpowered the BBQ and bacon. Fries were delish!\nKids menu - Mac & Cheese - great dish for kids, cheese was nice and creamy\nIce Cream Sundae - decent, nothing noteworthy",negative,en
"Not many Chinese food options out in Surprise, but this one is the best.

I'd stay away from the crab puffs...small and not very tasty. They do have awesome egg rolls...get 'em instead.

"Посещала комплекс 2ой раз с 2мя детьми 12 и 6 лет. Сам комплекс уникальный: 11 видов саун, бассейн с морской водой под открытым небом. И, как часто у нас бывает в России, цена несоответствующая сервису и отношению к клиенту. По сравнению с прошлым годом цена выросла, а сервис стал хуже. 1) нет почасовой тарификации, только 2 либо 4 часа 2) на каждого человека даётся по 2,15 или 4.15. Мы приехали вечером, за 3 часа до закрытия, брать 4 часа смысла не было. Взяли 2 часа. Когда ты один, то можно уложиться без проблем в 2,15 с раздеванием и одеванием. Когда ребёнок это сразу +15 минут, которых нам собственно и не хватило и получился перелимит. 3) в раздевалках очень мало место. Тесно. Мало скамеек. Это крайне неудобно с детьми, особенно если в одном месте переодеваются ещё несколько человек. 4) очереди в раздевалки. Вообще система с отдельными раздевалками и шкафчиками в другом месте крайне неудобная. В раздевалке в прошлый раз дочь забыла вещи, в этот раз тоже. 5) в душевых не было горячей воды в половине кабинок. Сломаны переключатели воды. Соответственно большинство просто не моются, а сразу идут в бассейн. 6) в крытом бассейне не работал массаж (джакузи) 7) в прошлом году для детей были надувные круги, матрасы, нарукавники, в этом году увы. 8) деньги берут за всё: прокат полотенца, халата, тапочек 9) в душевых нет ничего, куда можно было бы положить вещи, это очень неудобно\n\nСпрос есть и он будет по многим причинам, поэтому особо не рассчитываю на то, что на этот отзыв обратит внимание комплекс, а уж тем более сделает какие-то выводы.",negative,ru

"This hotel tries so hard to be a 4 star hotel and resort. It is not! Don't get me wrong the property has plenty of worth while amenities, however as far as San Diego (Pacific Beach) goes, you can get much more for your dollar down by the ocean. The bay is somewhat dirty and not very appealing to the eye. It is very overpriced, especially the restaurants and the room service. Cost $65 for breakfast in our room the first night there for two people. Furthermore, the location is horrible, unless you plan to stay only at the property. There isn't anything within reasonable walking distance. So you have 2 options, rent a car or take taxi's. Well, its $32 a day just to park at the property. Taxi service just to PB down by the ocean costs $20 a way, downtown costs $32 a way and down to the harbor is about $29 a way. So if you plan on doing activities plan on some travel or parking money!! Now, if you do decide to stay there, find Marlon the bell hop. He has plenty of information as to where to go and he is a great guide of the property. If it wasn't for him taking us around the property and showing us everything we would have had no idea some of it was there!!

"As a full time traveler, I eat at a lot of restaurants so it takes something truly special to earn a five-star rating in my book. Bliss/reBAR did just that today. The crowd spilling out on the sidewalk, on a Sunday afternoon, was our first clue the restaurant would be good. A friendly staff greeted us at the door and seated us immediately.\n\nThe menu looked like comfort food gone wild. Everything was tempting so choosing was difficult. Thanks to Jim, our exceptionally helpful waiter, we selected two of the house specialties and split them between us -- we were both hungry and still couldn't finish everything. We had the Mac n Cheese, with Chicken and Bacon and also Mama's Pot Roast dinner. \n\nThe pot roast was exceptionally tender and served over a flavorful cauliflower mashed; this was accompanied by done-just-perfect asparagus. The mac n cheese was out of this world. Unlike most we've tried, the cheese in this dish was ultra light and creamy. Adding a generous portion of chicken (and just enough bacon) made this dish a real delight. Add in a fabulous mimosa deal on Sunday and this meal was perfect.\n\nAlthough we're only in the Valley for a few months, we'll be heading back to Bliss/reBAR often (and bringing our friends as well!). We learned from Chef Eric they make their own cheese sause for the mac n cheese...perhaps he'll share that recipe with us on our next visit!",positive,en
"The Fairmont is a beautiful, older (but modernized) hotel in a prime Seattle location. The hotel is walking distance from most city sights, including the waterfront, aquarium, shopping, Market and many more.
The lobby is old-style, large and comfortable, with oriental rugs, lots of wood, etc. Check-in was quick. Getting to the room -- not so quick. The hotel has four, quite small and quite slow elevators, one or more of which was almost always out of order in the two days we stayed there. Thus, at peak times such as mornings and dinner-time, there was a 5-10 minute wait. And, when the elevator finally did arrive, it was filled, because it only holds 5-6 people, without luggage. With luggage, it's crowded with 3.
Our room was disappointing. Knowing that older hotels have a hodgepodge of rooms, many of which are smaller than modern hotels, I didn't expect much. Still the room was VERY small with no view. Queen bed. Only one chair -- thus, one of us had to sit on the bed to watch the very small TV. Of course, because the chair and bed were directly opposite (and the room was too small to move the chair next to the bed), we both could not watch TV at the same time w/o craning our necks. There was almost no place on the floor to put our suitcases and we ended up tripping over them.
Room decor was ok -- not memorable -- and bed was comfortable. The A/C worked well and I believe there was a mini-bar (didn't use it). However, the room was so small that we didn't want to do anything there but sleep.
The bathroom, by contrast, was a good size with lots of marble and nice amenities. Rooms were very well-insulated and there is an in-room safe. Wakeup call was timely and staff was very friendly. The concierge desk was well-manned and provided excellent suggestions.
We tried the hotel restaurant for breakfast. The food was good and served fairly promptly. Cost was about what you'd expect for a high-end hotel.
Workout room was modern and there was plenty of staff to assist.
Overall, the stay was ok but, if coming again, for the same price I'd stay down the street at the Hotel Monaco or just try another hotel in the city.",negative,en

"I stayed here because it is close to my office. It was supposed to be a respite from dealing with post-Hurricane Sandy commuter train problems. I’ve stayed at a wide range of hotels in Manhattan over the years, from downtown boutiques to middle-of-the-road chains to grand 5-star properties. Relative to these other stays, my experience at the St. Giles Court was pretty dismal. The only good part – the doormen were unfailingly friendly and professional. However, check-in was perfunctory and rushed (though there was no one in line behind me). Loud music poured into the small under-populated lobby from the adjacent, under-populated bar, giving it a trashy, depressing quality rather than hip or chic. The room was dreary. Poorly lighted and the bedside lamp was missing its finial - so the shade hung there, crooked and sad. The carpet was badly frayed and worn at the bathroom threshold. There was an acrid odor of air freshener covering old (?) cigarette smoke. The ancient heater under the window blew dust and rattled loudly when it went on. The black metal double-hung window was drafty and a vinyl roller shade served as the only window covering. The bathroom sink did not drain properly so water quickly filled the basin and bits of hair and whatever else came up from below as it filled. The shower arm/showerhead rattled violently when turned on, as though it might snap off the wall at any moment. I think this kind of kind of second-rate faux boutique hotel concept (lipstick on a dumpy old hotel property) would have played better in the pre-recession world. But now, it is just a bad value when there are so many better options at the same price point in midtown.",negative,en

Beds are fantastic as everyone says.No gym in the hotel but you do get free access to a very well equiped gym 50 metres away that opens at 5.30am.

That party then became 2 because it was ridiculous how slow they were moving. The food was okay but only $1.99 so you can't complain. Then the next night we ended up here for a group dinner because people were sick of the food court. The food looked okay and tasted okay at the table. When we all went out separate ways after dinner and met up back in our hotel rooms, multiple people were sick.

"I stayed at the hotel for a week-long business trip in Chicago. The hotel was selected for me and the price was a bit over $200 per night.
Location: Right on Michigan Ave. Great if you are in town for sightseeing or business. If you want to get around town on the 'L' it's a short walk up Wabash to the station. There are some restaurants in the area. We ate at the Emerald Loop and found it to be good.
Check-in: Relatively fast. My room selection was correct. No problems.
Room: 19th floor. Generally well decorated and laid out. The room has a flat screen TV. Unfortunately the TV stopped working on Thursday of my stay. Rather disappointing. But since I was checking out the next day, it wasn't worth it to call a technician. Bathroom was clean, although the shower head didn't hold its position very well. It would slip and forced me to stand almost against the wall to get water. There is in-room internet, but it costs $10 or so a day to use it. I really hate hotels that still charge for internet. It's like having an extra tax slapped on you.
Hotel: The property is in the old Carbide & Carbon Building. Its an older building and when you first walk in, the Art Deco Interior screams at you. The lobby itself is modern. Bar on the first floor. Once inside the renovated areas, you get all of the rock star kitsch hanging about. There is an internet station with two computers in the lobby to print boarding passes and check email. The computers are always being used, probably because of the in-room charge. There is a Chinese restaurant that serves breakfast in the morning. I think it was about $18 for the breakfast buffet. OK, not fantastic. Small selection of hot food with a bread/pastry stand. Its not laid out well for a buffet and can be tough to get around if there are more than a few people milling about.
Service: OK. I typically don't want maid service until I need things tidied up. But there wasn't a ""Do Not Disturb"" sign around. So I called the front desk and told them that I wouldn't need housekeeping. When I got back, I found that housekeeping had been in the room. So I had to call down for a ""Do Not Disturb"" sign. On one of the days, my 7:30 wake up call was really late. Fortunately the alarm on my IPhone woke me up. But that's not something that I consider to be acceptable.
Overall: I just wasn't impressed. My company paid good money and I think I could have done better elsewhere. The TV breaking down was just the last thing in a line of events that gave me pause. I strongly recommended to other colleagues headed out to Chicago that they should choose another property. If the hotel is priced far below the competition, you might consider it. But I think there will be strong alternatives for what they charge.",negative,en

The server said we must have read an old menu and it wasn't offered any more. And my cheese plate was lacking the spiced nuts (they were out).\n\nI saw pieces of candy wrappers in the hallway that made it thru the night and were still present in the morning. And then there was the big ol' fake eyelash stuck to a base board in our bathroom.....\n\nI'd come back, though. We got a nice deal thru Hotwire and it was very much worth what we paid.

"Pros: Rooms are spacious and clean. We were in a deluxe king room which was large enough for a family of 4 utilizing the queen pull out sofa. Location is safe and tucked away within the historic old Montreal area. Complimentary breakfast buffet is substantial and they even have take away containers for afternoon snacks. We also enjoyed the microwave and in room fridge. \n\nCons: The housekeeping staff is extremely unfriendly. No greeting in the hall unless you consider a smirk and begrudging good morning mumble when you annoy them with a greeting. We also asked for beer glasses and were told we should use the room 4oz water glasses. Weird in the land of microbrews and a hotel with room service that serves beer. \n\nAll in all, not a bad stay but in the same breath, not a good one either. Common courtesies go a long way.

For whatever reason, this place seemed understaffed and only 2 people were on the line. The other place I can see the cook flipping the marinated meats on the grills.

Even more as the restaurant is very open with a huge amount of seating.\n\nThe wifey and I ordered a Chicken Ranchera Burrito with guacamole and chips. The chips are made fresh daily, and they were lightly salted, which were somewhat bland. The burrito was tasty that had a nice flavor from the fajitas.

"Yes, this place can be pricey but it was a great stay in Montreal. We paid ~ $750 for three week nights in October. \n\nLocation: Fabulous because it was near the quaint old town area with plenty of areas to stroll through and pick up breakfast. 1 block away from the metro stop and about 3 blocks from China Town. About 5 blocks from the water front and Archeology museum. \n\nService: Very friendly and tried to be professional but some odd answers to my questions. They seemed to always try to sell their own restaurant whenever we wanted suggestions from the concierge...even when we asked to find St.Viateur for their famous bagels. I also tried to get a room with a good view - one of the customer service reps said she would try, since the rooms were not ready when we arrived. But then another service rep looked at her and mumbled something in French... She then said that our room does have a good view and then within the same sentence, said that really, there were not good views in this hotel. Then, our toilet had very low water pressure so I called the front desk who said they would relocate us to another room. 15 minutes later, after frantically packing our things, a guy comes up to the room and says no other rooms are available and they would fix it in the a.m. \""A\"" for effort but \""C\"" for the odd answers and possibly... lack of experience? \n\nRooms: Loved the brick walls and hard wood floors INSIDE the rooms - a lot of personality with very high ceilings. Big bathroom with full bath. Good blow dryer in the room, iron and board, umbrella, robes, iphone/ipod dock on radio. Bed was a bit firm for me (I am soft biased) but otherwise comfy. \n\nFitness room: small but my husband said was good enough - had cardio machines and weights. \n\nWe received a free drink voucher for their restaurant upon checkin. Our friends also stayed in the hotel and opted to buy package deal that included 4 free metro passes and coupons... not sure how much more they spent but they also got a bigger room.",neutral,en

Да и беспроцентный срок весьма неплохой четыре месяца. В основном пользуюсь этой картой, когда покупаю что-то крупное, наподобие бытовой техники и т.п. На мой взгляд, очень удобно, потому что за дающиеся беспроцентные четыре месяца можно успеть погасить долг. По зиме думаю сделать ремонт в квартире. А так как это удовольствие весьма дорогое, то вероятно будут брать кредит. Если такая необходимость возникнет, то снова обращусь в этот банк.

"The descriptions of the rooms I read and saw in no way reflected the small size of our room. I had called to confirm everything, as we were traveling to San Antonio for my birthday. When the reservations agent learned of my birthday, he said he would put in for an up grade. I think they misspelled it and wrote ""down grade."" An undersized queen size bed barely fit. We could not order room service, and no menu was provided for a very good reason - there was only one small desk chair and no room for any type of tray. Even the flat screen was placed on top of the dresser, because there was no wall space. Luckily, a friend who joined us, was placed in a regular room which was spacious. I don't know if I'm allowed to say the room number, but it had ""09"" at the end (in fact, a part of the room number was missing from the space beside the door). When I called Guest Services, I was informed that they were not at the hotel and had no idea what this room did not have to offer. San Antonio is a lovely city where we spend a weekend each year for my birthday.

"I thoroughly enjoyed this film, which in many ways, as Hitchcock did on several occasions, was a first attempt at a plot which he re-shot later in his career. Possibly the most amazing thing about it, however, is how faceless the lead characters are. After watching, one remembers Murray Alper as the jovial truck driver, Vaughan Glaser's touching turn as a blind ""patriot"", the unforgettable traveling Freak Show and of course Otto Kruger as the suave and sophisticated villain, all of whom completely overshadow Bob Cummings as the rather wooden fugitive (compare that bridge jump to Harrison Ford's similar stunt in Andrew Davis' ""The Fugitive"") and Priscilla Lane whose change of heart and subsequent love towards Cummings is never quite believable.The other major support player is, of course, Hitchcock himself who bookends the film with 2 extraordinary stunts. Many people criticise the older films for their lack of realistic special effects. My feelings are that with lack of technology, to even attempt and convey what the director wants to show is an amazing achievement.Obviously this film carries an anti-fascist message, made at the time of the Second World War, but being a Hitchcock it is never the most important thing and the emphasis is always on the action. Well worth checking out, especially for the support roles.",positive,en

"This was my first time flying with Aegean, and my experience was anything but pleasant. Starting from when I checked-in at the counter, I have an SA Gold member where I get 20kg of free luggage, but the staff there says I have to pay another 45 Eur even though it should be free, and I explained that I have SA Gold and it should be free because I had a return ticket and I got 20kg free but the staff didn't care but tore the baggage tag in front of me and told me to go to the ticket agent at the airport, luckily the agent helped me a little bit to help me input manually, even though my status was still valid instead will be extended until next year. The second problem was when I was about to board in Athens, when it was my turn they stopped me and asked for a Moroccan visa or residence permit, I said my passport didn't need a visa to Morocco for up to 3 months and I even gave him a look at the Moroccan visa policy and he really didn't care.",negative,en
"Stayed at this hotel one night while on business in the area. It is an older hotel but well maintained. In my opinion the biggest plus for this hotel is its friendly staff who wanted to make sure your needs were met. At breakfast, my server checked several locations to see if they had the kind of bagel I wanted - they didn't but I appreciated the effort and stuck with my original choice! I went to arrange a cab for a short ride and the transportation captain said they would be happy to take me in their van when I was ready and followed through with someone ready to go when I came back - great service! One complaint is the air conditioner took a few hours to really cool down the room - it was hot and steamy in Dallas so maybe that couldn't be helped. The price for my stay was reasonable compared to other hotels and the location convenient if you have business in the area.",neutral,en

"I've been to the Barnyard Flea Market several times now, always on a Saturday. I give it three stars for a serious \""hit-or-miss\"", and one extra star for plenty of parking and just because I love flea markets and outdoor markets. There's also two produce sellers inside who have great prices for avocados. I love me some avocado, especially at 85 cents a pop! I've picked up a week's worth of veggies for under $10.\n\nThe parking can be a pain unless you navigate the outskirts of the lot. There is really nothing more annoying than gridlock due to 2 or 3 people who can't figure out what the f* they're doing. I realize we're in the \""laid back South\"", but some of us don't want to spend our lives idling our cars and holding our breath until we get to move a few inches forward only to stop again. \n\nI've found decent stuff about 50% of the time I come here. It's a good place to find quirky gifts (Beatrix Potter dishware for that random Peter Rabbit fan.. did I just date myself?), or if you need some bakeware. Seriously I found a 9x12 Pyrex for $6. That'd be, what, $20+ at Target? It's not a screaming deal, but you'd have better luck here than at a thrift shop.. and it smells a lot nicer. \n\nAbout 65% of the booths are nonsense: old Avon products and cheap shoes or junk food. Gross. At least 20% of the booths are cell phone cases and accessories. The cases seem pretty cheap and not in the good way, but the cords are legit. Most of them will carry the original manufacturer charging cables for pretty cheap. \n\nI've seen some seriously nice stuff here, like a stone chess set that was just gorgeous. The guy said it was $40, which of course in flea market world really means somewhere between $33-38, or something (I'm not very good at the haggling). I've seen beautiful African carvings, seasonal items (Christmas dishtowels for $2, anyone?), even some pretty decent bookshelves. \n\nI would recommend several things:\n- Right around 9:45-10am seems to be the magic time during the colder months. I think it was more 9:15am during the summer. \n- Skirt the parking lot or pull up right to the building-doorways. It's like people are afraid to go all the way in (just the tip?!?), so I've always found spots here.\n- Bring cash to make your life easier, but do the small bills. It helps if you're haggling not to whip out the $20 bill. At least it helps me feel like less of a d*ck.\n- Get some tamales at Rico's Tamales. It's in the 2nd building in towards the center where the restrooms are. Trust me on this. They're $2 each and they are easily some of the most delicious tamales I've had outside of Mexico and Southwestern America. It's out of a truck and there's a fancy hand printed and lopsided sign. Whatever. Books and covers, you know? They're DELICIOUS.",neutral,en

"Checked into the Peninsula New York for five nights over Thanksgiving. While i had read the reviews of snobby behavior of the staff, i experienced quite the opposite. Front Desk was always quite attentive always saying hello as we passed by. Concierge could not have been more helpful. I do see however, how some people could have seen how the staff acted snobby. It does seem that if one weren't dressed a certain way, one would definitely be treated differently. The only thing snobby one bit was the concierge always saying, ""the best as usual Mr. XXXXX?"" Upon arrival in the room, came to find a small cake perfected with berries, in celebration of my son's birthday. I do have to say that the staff was always so courteous, mainly because they usually had done something wrong or something was not working. The list of the things that did not work or were wrong: the birthday cake ordered weeks in advance, that had been confirmed, for my son's birthday was not what we had specified and confirmed numerous times, in an attempt to have that not happen, the stopper in the bathtub did not work after we had added the expensive bath salts, and the big kicker, the HEATER DID NOT WORK. I mean the temperature outside was really cold, as one would expect in NYC in the winter, and to have the heater not work was a real pain. The food was absolutely amazing. Room service was especially accomodating when we ordered dinner from the normal dinner menu instead of the all day dining, even though it was passed the cutoff time. The one good thing about it was its convenient location when it came to shopping. It is right at the corner of 56th and 5th Avenue. Would i stay there again? Probably not.

"I stayed 3 nights at this hotel for business. The hotel is located at the rear of the Domain shopping outdoor mall behind the parking lots. You have to take a little bit of a slow drive (1 lane/each way road) within the Domain to get to the hotel. It's not a big hotel. There are 6 floors.
This was my first experience with the aLoft brand. I don't like it, though there's definitely a market for it. It brings me back to my college days because this hotel felt like a really sweet brand new dorm that your really cool friends were able to get into. There's a DYI feel to it because you have a veneer of trendiness and then on closer inspection,it seems a bit cheap.
I had a king-size bedroom. The room measured around 250 sq foot. The bed was a true king size, though it was not a Starwood Heavenly bed. The bed was decent and I did not have any complaints with the sleep quality over my 3 nights. The comforter is on the lighter side (but this is Texas so there's no point in having very thick blankets). The bathroom is not truly a separate room because there's only a wall that separates it from the rest of the room. I thought the sink was too small and too low. There was always water getting onto the floor. There's a good-size walk-in shower. (No bathtub.) The handlebar on the glass shower door got loose on my 2nd night and I just left it as it was. The bath towels were Walmart quality.
There is no closet. What you have is a little bar opposite the sink to hang about 5 pieces of clothing. There are no drawers anywhere. There is plenty of shelf space throughout the room so I ended up just putting my used clothing in a bag on a shelf.
I got on the free WiFI and the connection speed was good on the 6th floor.
There are 2 elevators and it takes about 30 seconds or more to call it.
I paid a little bit over $150 per night (before taxes). In hindsight, I wouldn't have booked a room at this hotel for that rate, perhaps closer to $110. For business travelers, I would suggest sticking to the Four Points by Sheraton brand if you want to do low end Starwood. Otherwise, I think Hilton Garden Inn would get you more bang for the buck.",neutral,en
"Love love love the ambiance of this place. My date and I were seated in the \""outdoor\"" terrace area which is really a faux outdoor next to faux greenery but it was beautiful and much more private. When we first arrived in our cozy area there was only one other couple on the terrance. Our area was so quiet, it really made you put your phone away and just be \""in the moment\"" with someone. I think the tables and lighting are placed appropriately where you feel like you're in our own little bubble away from everyone else.\n\nI don't remember any exact plates that I liked. We had the 16 course meal and the food became a blur of goodness. Everything was executed well. Service was superb, everyone was extremely friendly and each plate came out not too long after we finished the previous plate. I do remember the amazing giant blob of butter in a giant bell jar! Imported from Great Britain the server said. I wanted the bread cart to come around just so I could see the butter being shaved. When the dessert cart came around I had to try one of each! \n\nOverall, it was a very fun and romantic experience. I'll probably skip the 16 course next time and order a la carte though.",neutral,en

"I am so excited to be only the 6th person to review Passion8 Bistro! \n\nDo not let the little number of reviews steer you from trying this very unique restaurant. I was taken here for my birthday dinner date but actually had no idea where we were going as it was a surprise. With living in the uptown area, this place was definitely out of the way, but it is completely worth it. It is really only about 20 minutes from uptown but the restaurant is located down a far dirt road so it makes it seem further away than it truly is. The restaurant is a small house with a larger patio built on the back.\n\nWe had an early dinner so it was still light outside and much darker inside. The decor inside was extremely interesting with kitchy little knick knacks everywhere and dark red painted walls. The bathroom even reminded me of what my Grandma's bathroom would look like. But it was cozy despite the strange decor and also gave the dining room the flair that so many other eateries lack. \n\nWe were the first table to arrive for dinner (around 5:30) and were seated promptly because of our reservation and the menu was explained to us as well as the beer and wine list by our very knowledgeable server. There is no menu online for Passion8 Bistro because it changes so often. I've heard the chef really knows his stuff and the cuisine definitely proved that point. I ordered a salad that was deconstructed with green apples, cubed beets, fresh nuts, goat cheese and mustard vinaigrette. (MY type of salad!!) The appetizer that we ordered started off small so we were worried about the size of the other portions considering all menu items were fairly pricey. Were we wrong.. after finishing an appetizer and salad each, we were presented with the scallops. We each ordered the scallops but I suggested mine with risotto instead of succotash. 4 HUGE fresh scallops were beautifully presented on a place with risotto and deliciously prepared beets. I do not really care for beets but these were awesome! I ate every bite of my dish and even though I was stuffed, I of course saved room for dessert, which was a tiramisu cake with coffee ice cream. Nothing was left behind by us two. After we were finished with our entrees, the chef actually walked by our table and cleared our plates while walking back to the kitchen.. now THAT is personal service! :)\n\nThis was such a great birthday dinner and I would DEFINITELY return to Passion8 Bistro again for a special occasion. If you are considering a nice dinner and would like to get out of the same Charlotte areas.. try Fort Mill instead! The ingredients are super fresh, the menu is well-thought out and service was personal and attentive. I personally think the food here is better than most steakhouses and more expensive fine dining places in Charlotte.",positive,en

The Chelsea Savoy Hotel also has complimentary breakfast and coffee and USA Today and the New Yorker (I'm pretty sure) newspapers delivered at your doorstep.
However, I got a 2nd floor room right on the corner of 23rd and 7th and it got noisy at times. Also, the cable doesn't work too well and there aren't many channels. But, this is NYC! Why watch TV when there's a whole city outside?

"There is some good material in this course. The text is fairly good. But I have two main reservations about the course. The first is that the lectures do not always correspond closely enough with the quizzes, and with the text. There are times when one can take a quiz and think, How exactly does this relate to the lectures I just saw? The text has quite a few exercises, but there is a tendency to throw in one or two problems whose difficulty is an order of magnitude above everything else in that section, and I find this discouraging and a waste of time. Save those for a later course, or put them into a separate Extra Challenges section. Learning calculus is hard enough without trying to grapple without some really tricky trig problem at the same time. as a single example.The second reservation is with the instructors manner. Many students find it very enjoyable. I am not one of them. Much of the time, hes OK, especially when the camera is not pointed at him. But as the course progresses, much of the footage is of him at his desk, and the closeups become more and more extreme, the hand-waving and fist-clenching approach sheer windmilling, and the exaggerated eye-rolling, grinning and so forth become so distracting that I cant bear to watch. I realize that the goal was to avoid being a dry-as-dust droning professor, and that is commendable, but there is a happy middle ground between that and hamming. I can almost speculate that there was an impulse to add in cartoon sproing-bonk-cuckoo-klaxon sound effects. (There is actually one such sound effect, but just one, so I wont quibble on that.)I would have found the class more effective with a demeanor that was enthusiastic without being histrionic. Im sure this is one of those you either love it or hate it things, and I may be in the minority.The instructor is not generally one to throw out some concept that has not already been learned and then just motor on without explanation. He errs on the side of overly-detailed explanation, which to me is preferable to skipping over subjects or techniques and assuming you know them.Having said all of this, I repeat that there is good material, and you can learn the fundamentals of calculus for free in this course.",positive,en

"Территория очень красивая, много места где можно посидеть (в парке, на набережной, на многочисленных балконах - с потрясающими видами - это очень здорово!!! За это - спасибо 🔥👍)\nЕда в столовой шведский стол - очень вкусная и разнообразная. Днём можно поиграть в настольный теннис (но стол мы нашли только один), вечером можно поиграть в бильярд, или попеть караоке на огромном экране в ресторане (там тоже очень вкусно 👍🤤).\nБанный комплекс - тоже всё здорово, открытый подогреваемый бассейн и можевеловая парная рядом с ним - супер 🔥🌟🤟\nНесколько парковок и много парковочных мест.\nПанорамный лифт на набережную и потрясающие виды 🔥☀️🏞️\n\nТеперь из минусов: мы отдыхали в межсезонье. Вечером в марте здесь делать абсолютно нечего, весь отель как будто вымирает 🙄\nНесмотря на март с трудом нашли место для парковки (охранник указал место куда я должна поставить машину) и хотя были свободные парковочные места - на них стояли фишки, наверное, ""для своих"", а мне пришлось парковаться вплотную к стене и вылазить через пассажирскую дверь. А охранник даже не подсказал, где можно развернуться, чтобы к стене притереться пассажирской дверью, что бы не ""корячиться"" в машине.\nПри заселении в номере не было банных полотенец, а только для ног и ещё небольшого размера (скорее для лица) - я не жаловалась на ресепшен... подумала так здесь заведено, но через пару дней при смене белья банные полотенца добавили - делаю вывод, что при нашем заселении полотенца не доложили.\nВ открытом бассейне парень, выдающий полотенца сказал, что гидродуш не работает, однако для своего знакомого на 15 минут его включил 🙄.\n\nНесмотря на минусы, отдых здесь всё-таки понравился - повезло с погодой, вкусная еда и место здесь потрясающее.\nНо поскольку я простой гость без каких либо привилегий, сюда, наверное, больше не приеду.",negative,ru

"After staying at other Radisson during our tour, we were expecting a great hotel. Service there was none - we struggled with our suitcases - had to request a bar fridge for our room - took the hotel 24 hoiurs to replace our TV remote that did not work after several calls to them. Drycleaning was meant to be delivered by 6.30 - after suffering jetlag we crashed at 8.30pm and 15 minutes later I awoke to knocking and just before I got to the door it opened - imagine if we had of woke up with a stranger in our room????? The rooms were not soundproof - banging and crashing, walking in the room above, when we complained they offered to move us but hey we declined as we did not want to move all our stuff out they could have gone to the room above us and asked them to tone it down. There was no hotel bar where you could get a nice beer and lounge around the great heated pool. The only plus was that the housekeeping of the room was excellent.

"I've always wanted to visit this hotel since its opening but never managed to and last night we went to celebrate our anniversary at Thirty8 restaurant, located on the 38th floor, overlooking the twin Towers. We were placed in a booth and I like the intimacy of a booth but it was so dark. Could hardly read the menu....what a pity! There were many birthdays being celebrated as well so it was a joyous place. We started with a Beetroot salad, arugula, goat cheese, pecan nut, balsamic dressing (RM47). It came with very few leaves of arugula and a little bit of goat cheese and big pieces of beetroot and hardly any dressing....very disappointing. I can make better salad presentation and better tasty dish than that one. My husband had Hot and sour seafood soup (RM35), he said it was OK. Then I ordered Tasmanian salmon trout, fennel, lemon, cedar wood (RM105). The salmon was really very tasty, and moist but hardly any fennel and really nothing else, on a piece of cedar wood!!! (another disappointment). My husband ordered Tiger prawns, lemon, garlic butter (RM99) and again, hardly any butter and it certainly did not taste garlic butter and very dry and pretty tasteless. We ordered some Roasted pumpkin, reggiano parmesan (RM30) and again no taste and dry. When the head waiter asked us about the food we told them the truth, how disappointing it was. He was kind and offered us desserts but we declined or coffee/tea and we also declined. We did not come for freebies. We wanted to have a nice meal to celebrate a special event and ended up extremely disappointed. We ordered a bottle of Australian red wine and it was fine. The total bill came to RM462 and I can honestly say I have eaten far better meals for very much less. It is very expensive but the food is not worth it.I would not recommend this restaurant nor would I want to go back.",negative,en

"My travel agent asked me to go for this Triton Hotel because the neighbouring Marriott hotels were found full 2 days before the start of my business trip and I settled for it accordingly, as it was only for one night ""transit"" stay.
The hotel location is convenient and the staff friendly, the common areas and the rooms are slightly worn out but acceptable.
The main problem is that the rooms are equipped with ""window-type"" air-conditioning units which are noisy when operating, and gives no fresh air. [N.B.: Travellers who read this review may trust my judgement as I have been belonging to the property discipline for many years.]
After switching on the units at night for 2 hours, the room becomes nothing but noisy and stuffy, lacking oxygen. To open the windows for fresh air means 2 other problems: firstly, my room (and may be half of the rooms in such hotel) faces the side lane where the refuse rooms of the hotel and other adjoining buildings are located and can catch such ""unforgettable"" smell; secondly, the service vehicles and refuse-collection vehicles in US operate at nights, with their dumping and travelling noises throughout the night-time.
So, the result is: ""shallow-sleeping people"" like me cannot sleep.
Fortunately, it was only for one night stay, and I presume I would not be returning again unless they install some centralized ventilation system with treated air.
One point worth mentioning: the hotel's web-page didn't show any ""window-type"" air-conditioning units in any of their rooms' interior photos, and ""experienced people"" like me would return to the website and find from the exterior night-view photo some ideas of the ""window-type"" air-conditioning units along the dim facades. I wished I had noticed those ""window-type"" air-conditioning units before I agreed to my travel agent's former offer.",negative,en

"Watching this odd little adventure movie, it's hard to believe that it was directed by the same man who brought us such high quality Giallo classics as The Strange Vice of Mrs Wardh and The Case of the Scorpion's Tail, but it has to be said that despite it's low quality production values, Island of the Fish Men is an entertaining ride and one that surely deserves more praise than it's getting. Like many Italian films from the seventies, this is one is a rip off of a successful American film, the one in question this time being the critically panned Island of Dr Moreau. Sergio Martino's film takes ideas such as mutation, greed and adventure and moulds it into one slightly compelling film, which makes up for what it's lacks in coherency and logic with a load of mostly intriguing ideas. The central plot follows a boat which crashes on a small island. It quickly becomes apparent that not everything about this place is normal, and it soon transpires that half of the population has been turned into ""fish men"" - a cross between a man and a fish, which exist for purely selfish reasons...The truth about this movie is that it's a lot more fun if you ignore the trashy production values. The central monsters look completely ridiculous, and much of the movie takes place on sets that look like they cost someone a few pennies - but the movie is well shot in spite of this, with the underwater photography being a particular highlight and the pacing of the movie is well done in that the film never becomes boring. The way that the plot comes together isn't exactly genius, but it takes in a lot of ideas and I've seen films made on plots with much less thought put into them than this one. The biggest location standout in the film is definitely the lost city of Atlantis. To be honest, I'm not a massive fan of adventure movies, and therefore don't see this lost city get mentioned much - but it is always nice to see it in a movie. The central island location is good in that it provides an apt setting for the story and also provides the movie with the right amount of mystery, as Martino makes good use of the voodoo theme. Overall, this isn't exactly a classic and there are certainly a lot worse trashy adventure movies out there than this one.",positive,en

"This hotel was convenient, nice breakfast for a quickie, reasonable cost and close to the hospital where my mom was staying. I was in NYC for family medical reasons and the hospital had a listing of several hotels in the area. I called every one of them and finally picked this hotel. I got a price quote for the five nights and it was faxed pretty quickly. I arrived on a Friday and before I went to my room, I asked Ela at the desk how much it would cost to upgrade the room to two beds. I was told $20 dollars. I said fine when my Dad comes to NYC he can share a room rather than getting his own. By Sunday I asked Preya for the room upgrade and the price went up to $60 more. I said that is not I was quoted and thought to wait the next night. Monday I asked the nice guy Henry or Harry and he gave me the upgrade for $20. Tuesday went to the hospital for the day and came back with my dad. Went to the room and it was locked out. Came back to the desk and Preya said I didn't sign out in time and they were holding my bags. I asked for the manager and she said she was the manager. She said the price is $60 more. I told her I was quoted twice by two others and the extra cost is $20. She said since I am signing in without reservations the price went up. I told her she increased the price two days before and I had reservations. She eventually got me the real manager and he was not helpful either. I paid the difference since I had no where to go with an 82 year old parent standing in a hallway waiting to get our belongings. Ela and Henry or Harry whatever his name was, was nice and polite. I will never forget the rude and uncaring manager(s) and I will contact the hospital to let them know about the inconsistencies within their own group. I understand prices change every day but to change and flip flop on charges every other day with the same person is rather suspicious.",negative,en

They don't allow sneakers or so they say but there were several people with sneakers coming in and out of the club.

We were suppouse to surprise her but that got ruined with all the hassle we got. My husband was wearing sneakers cause he forgot his at home from rushing so he hunted down some shoes.

I stayed 2 night at this hotel and i have nothing bad to say. You always have to keep in mind the price your paying. The hotel was clean & quiet. The room were nice. The location is easily accessible by car. We were traveling to the city by car and even when there was heavy traffic it was 30min max. Without a car it can be different cause you have to rely on the shuttle. You can easily get parking in boston for 15-20$/day. Makes your life easier. Overall i had a great experience and i would recommand if your on a budget. It was half the price vs hotel in downtown,positive,en
"While movie titles contains the word 'Mother', the first thing that comes to our mind will be a mother's love for her children.However, The Mother tells a different story.The Mother do not discuss the love between a mother and her child, or how she sacrifice herself for the benefit of her child. Here, Notting Hill director Roger Michell tells us how a mother's love for a man about half of her age hurts the people around her.Before Daniel Craig takes on the role of James Bond, here, he plays Darren, a man who is helping to renovate the house of the son of the mother, and sleeping with her daughter as well. Anne Reid, who was a familiar face on TV series, takes up the challenging role of the leading character, May.The story begins with May coping with the sudden loss of her husband, Toots, in a family visit to her son, Bobby. While she befriends Darren, a handyman who is doing some renovation in Bobby's house, she was shocked to found out that her daughter, Paula, was sleeping with Darren. At the same time, May was coping with life after the death of Toots. Fearing that Harry and Paula do not wanted her, May starts to find her life going off track, until she spends her afternoon with Darren.Darren was nice and friendly to May, and May soon finds some affection on Darren. Instead of treating him like a friend, she treated the man who was about half her age with love of a couple. Later, May found sexual pleasure from Darren, where he gave her the pleasure she could never find on anyone else. And this is the beginning of the disaster that could lead to the break down of a family.The Mother explores the inner world of a widow who wanted to try something she never had in her life, and solace on someone who is there for her to shoulder on. This can be told from May buying tea time snacks for Darren to fulfilling sexual needs from a man younger than her, where it eventually gave her more than she bargained for.Anne Reid has made a breakthrough for her role of May, as she was previously best well known for her various role on TV series. As she do not have much movies in her career resume, The Mother has put her on the critic's attention. Daniel Craig, on the other hand, had took on a similar role in his movie career, such as Sylvia (2003) and Enduring Love (2004). If his reprising role of James Bond fails, film reviewers should not forget that he has a better performance in small productions in his years of movie career, and The Mother is one of them.The Mother may not be everyone's favorite, but it is definitely not your usual matinée show to go along with tea and scones, accompanied by butter and jam.",positive,en

"comeundone, I love you! I could not have come to a better conclusion than you did about this movie and it's ending. My family has not seen this movie yet, but I know them too well; they will hate it. But this time, I watched it alone and I found that it affected me greatly. Although the movie is long in length, I was tied to the story and amazed by the ending. I initially thought it was weird as to how she just vanished, but on some level, it makes perfect sense.But like comeundone said, this movie does not make sense of reality.

"Stayed at the W for two nights during our weeklong trip to San Francisco. We were given a high floor as requested which was very nice. It was a pain to have to swipe our key cards every time we got on the elevator though.
The lobby/check-in/bar area is weird and funky, dark with loud music thumping from the bar. I am 43 and too old for this place I think. We visited The Living Room bar for drinks, which were outrageous. We have the same bar at the Dallas W, and are used to high drink prices, but still thought the prices over the top (i.e. $15 for a cocktail, $12 for a Jack&Coke). Unlike the bar at the Dallas W, this one was not packed, even though our stay was over the weekend.
The room was fine, with a nice shower and Bliss amenities as well as a nice sized single sink. The layout was a little weird but I kind of liked it. I thought the bed was comfortable but hubby could swear he felt feathers or something sticking out making it ""bumpy."" I woke up the first night with my nose burning and eyes streaming tears so I do think there is down or something in the bedding (I took a Benadryl the second night). I wore earplugs both nights but I don't believe noise was a factor.
The pool and hot tub were a joke. The pool was full of little kids and the acoustics were terrible so every scream was ear-piercing. We got in the hot tub and turned on the jets but nothing happened so we were left just sitting in a tub of hot water with splashing kids. There wasn't much seating around the pool. At the very least the hot tub should be adults-only. The pool and hot tub was a factor in choosing the W for our stay so this was disappointing. We didn't use the fitness area but it looked to be nice.
We got massages at Bliss spa and they were great, perfect for the end of our long trip. My therapist, Dennis, was great. The women and men have separate lounges, which contain tea, water, cheese and delicious brownie bites. However, the lounge area is brightly lit and a little noisy, not relaxing. Again, the hotel having a spa onsite was a factor since we chose this hotel for the end of our trip.
We had breakfast at Trace and service was very good and I had the Chilaquiles which were delicious and hubby had the french toast, with a side of sausage and juice, the bill was around $52.
The surrounding area was a bit dead. We had to walk several blocks on a Saturday afternoon to find a restaurant open or anything to do. We had spent the first part of the trip in the financial district and liked that area better.
Overall, it was just an OK stay, not a hotel I would come back to if I visit San Francisco again.",negative,en

"Lovely looking Hotel with very good rooms and facilities. There is plenty to do on site as the gym, pool and steam rooms are all available to guests. We have no complaints about the facilities at this historic Hotel. We are working class people and the booking was a treat to ourselves and we did feel a little out of place. Some of the staff were less than polite to us and asking questions was a problem to a couple of them on a couple of occasions. I guess we didn't fit the bill of the kind of customer they expect. Having said that, Bar, Restaurant and Coffee Bar staff were without criticism. They were fine polite and helpful at all times.
The area around the Hotel is not safe after dark and at weekends it dies as all the surrounding offices are empty. We went out to look around on our first day and found two blocks from the Hotel to be intimidating and this is just off of the Jewelery District, so an easy mistake to make. We were here for 4 days only and will not be returning. If you are going to LA for the first time, then look at Santa Monica, Anaheim and Pasadena as alternative places to stay. They are tourist friendly and near to all you will need to do whilst in LA. Avoid the Downtown at all costs.

"If you don't want to wait nearly an hour for your luggage, pack light and carry on, because you will be at baggage claim LONG before your luggage arrives there. Compared to LAX, O'Hare and even Miami (which is terrible), LAS has to be filled with the rudest, most self-centered people. You literally could be limping on a sprained ankle, carrying a purse and carry on bag and between you and your husband, have another 3 suitcases to maneuver, and still you should not expect anyone to be courteous enough to move for you. What you can expect is to walk 100 miles to baggage claim, wait for 30 minutes or more for the 1st piece of luggage (which will not be yours) to drop onto the carousel, fight mean stares and rude people to get out to the Taxi line, just to round the corner and see you will be getting a taxi just about in time to catch your flight home, in three days.\n\nHere's a tip: Either schedule a car service to meet you at the airport (yes, it will cost you $65 and YES, it is worth not having to wait in a taxi line) or look for a dude in a suit, pushing a luggage cart around, who you can tip $1 per bag and he will help you cut in line to get a taxi.

I ordered an eclair ($2.50 and it was very small), 2 peanut butter cookies ($1.95 each) and an individual red velvet cake ($9.95 which is way overpriced for one small cake). In my opinion I don't think they were worth the money. With those prices I expected it to be absolutely amazing. They weren't bad, I've just had better else where at half the cost.

"DOUBLE CHARGED...and was lied to by management.
I booked this hotel ""On-line"" for my wife and myself Friday, Aug. 12, 2005 for one night. The hotel is nothing better than 1-1/2 stars. We reserved a non-smoking room through their official site, but received a room that had ash trays. Do ash trays equal non-smoking? The room had a odd smell, but we did not complain to front desk...as it was only one night. The neighborhood is not a place to take your kids, nor yourself. There are not any restaurants, grocery stores, within walking distance. We had pizza delivered to our room from Dominoes. During the night there were many loud noises and people yelling once in a while.
NO PARKING...We ordered in because we didn't want to lose our parking spot. There are only about 20 parking spots for the 3 floors of motel rooms. People started parking in the two handicap spots as the side streets were full. The area just did not feel safe.
We booked this hotel a few weeks in advance to go to the Dodgers and Mets game on Saturday Aug. 13, 2005 then planned to drive back to our residence in central California after the game...HOWEVER...
THREE WEEKS LATER...I received my credit card bill and was charged $82.02 for Aug. 12, 2005...AND then another $82.02 for August 14, 2005. We had only booked for one night and only stayed for one night.
...I called the hotel to get reimbursed for the extra 82.02. The first time I called, I spoke with the night worker (Rafael, I think)...he looked up the paperwork and told me that I called to add a day to my stay. I explained to him that I reserved for one night and it was on-line only. He proceeded to tell me that I was wrong. I even have the receipt from the one night with ONLY Friday checked off (beyond the fact that I never called). Anyway, he told me to call back the next day to speak to the manager.
I spoke to the manager (Adrianna) and I received the same exact response. She even said I spoke to her about extending the stay (I never made any calls to the hotel or Super 8). I got really frustrated at this point. She said she would have to talk to the owners about the situation. What is the point of a manager if they can't take care of simple errors like this one.
...I have also called the main Super 8 phone number and all they said they can do at this point is submit a complaint which goes to the same hotel (not much sense in that is there?...even when I explained the hotel has not cooperated). Super 8 billing said that I would have to wait at least 7 days before they could butt into the situation (that I may add was not my fault or error, but instead the hotels).
I am going to call the hotel back today to see what the owners will say about the situation. I will update my review when the 82.02 is credited back to my account.
...If they cannot cooperate and solve a simple problem like this, I will submit my complaint to the District Attorney and copy it to the Better Business Bureau and get it solved myself. Who knows how many other people they have tried to DOUBLE CHARGE.
Next time I will stay at La Quinta or Baymont Inn. I am done with Super 8 after I get my 82.02 back in my wallet.

"Our family arrived at 9pm and were immediately welcomed enthusiastically by the bellhop (Eddie). He showed us to the front desk where check-in was quick and easy. Eddie brought our luggage to our room and we realized the room was a bit small with a crib and all of our luggage- but that is to be expected in a downtown hotel! However, within minutes we received a phone call that the front desk had found a larger room for our family for our stay. The staff went out of their way, without being asked, to accomodate our family- that is the kind of service you won't find in other hotel chains!!
The room we stayed in was quite large and had a nice view of the inner harbor. Some parts of the room/hotel are older, but everything is clean and well kept. The A/C was weaker- maybe 73 degrees when the thermostat said 65, but nothing to complain about.
The breakfast buffet was good- they have different menu items each day- from omlette's to french toast, and seem to always have a make-your-own waffle station available. The pastries and bread were fresh.
The location of the hotel is good- I didn't see anything to be concerned about in regards to safety-there are several hotels within a block of the area so there are many tourists walking around. It is about a 5 minute walk to the inner harbor.
Overall, I'd highly recommend this hotel because of the excellent service from the hotel staff.",positive,en

Basically, it's whole chicken baked in rock salt for hours so you get that salty taste on the meat without losing the essence. On top of that, you get the benefit of the smoked scent.You have the option of either getting a fresh packed, ready to be eaten in 2 days or a frozen one, for you to keep for no more than 6 months.To say the least, the salted chickens were decent.It's definitely a great item to buy as souvenir for relatives.",neutral,en

"Just returned from our second stay at the Hotel Monaco over the last few years. Our first visit was impressive - great staff, sparkling room and exquisite service. This time the visit was a little more humbling. While the staff remains very friendly, there seemed to be gaps in communication between the front desk and housekeeping, valets, etc. In addition, our suite was showing distinct signs of wear. The furniture was a little stained and tattered, and the trim was looking a little worn. For most places, this would be expected, but our expectations for the Monaco our always very high.
The Monaco continues to offer their complimentary evening wine and cheese hour (now featuring tarot card reading and neck/shoulder massages). The little extras do make the Monaco unique, but those expecting a well-equipped fitness facility will be disappointed with the cramped, almost dangerous, workout area.
The location is great, the staff is wonderful, the rooms are small. If you can accept these conditions, the Monaco is for you. While we are very fond of the Monaco, we will probably look elsewhere next time we visit San Francisco. For the price, the rooms need to reflect the taste and charm that made the Monaco unique. During our most recent visit, the charm was missing.",positive,en
"Avec Shakespeare, Dostoievski est l'autre grande influence occidentale d'Akira Kurosawa pour ce qui est de l'écriture. Et une fois de plus Kurosawa transcende l'oeuvre de départ en l'adaptant, respectant l'esprit d'origine tout en lui insufflant une vision nouvelle connotée par le destin du Japon au sortir de la guerre, qui fait état de ses nombreuses victimes physiques et psychologiques. «L'Idiot» est le récit de la prise de conscience d'un homme de la valeur de la vie, après avoir frôlé de très près la mort. Cet homme miraculé devient alors la bonté même, inévitable victime de la cruauté des autres dans une sorte d'apathie qui lui vaut le mépris de ceux qui l'entourent, ne voyant en lui qu'un simple ""idiot"", à l'exception d'une jeune fille innocente qui l'aime secrètement et d'une femme meurtrie qui trouve en lui la compassion et la compréhension qu'elle n'a jamais pu recevoir par ailleurs. Bouleversant les personnages et leurs rapports avec son arrivée dans leur vie, « l'idiot » sera bien sûr celui qui en subira les conséquences, comme si la bonté pure était insupportable pour les hommes. D'une mise en scène magistrale, «L'Idiot» est un drame déchirant et intense, porté par des acteurs d'exception au sommet de leur art : Masayuki Mori, Setsuka Hara et Toshirô Mifune. Un chef-d'oeuvre.

"Hotel Molto bello,la reception ben curata e molto elegante..sembrebbe di recente costruzione ma in realtà non lo è,è tenuto molto bene.Le camere sono complete di tutto.Molto carino l'arredamento con al posto della testata del letto un enorme cuscino,il lampadario zebrato.In camera il condizionatore faceva un gran rumore,e nonostante lo spengevo c'era il canale dell'aria installato nel cavedio dell'albergo che faceva ancora più rumore.
Al decimo piano,c'è una visuale bellissima di New York..si vede l'empire,il Crysler e il Gramcery..Ci sono due pc con Internet Gratis,in quanto in Wi-Fi costa US$10 al giorno,e il personale dell'albergo ci ho sconsigliato di comprare il Wi-Fi.Il servizio dell'albergo e cordialissimo.Sono rimasto colpito da un ragazzo dell'albergo, Thomas,simpaticissimo,disponibilissimo e di originale italiana,simpatizza la lingua italiana!!!La posizione è abbastanza centrale,è vicino a tutto,piccolo supermercato (Wallgreens) dove potete trovare di tutto per fare colazione,spuntini,panini,sigarette,gelati,acqua..Tutto!!La fermata della metro è sulla 23°(L'albergo è alla 24°).Inoltre proprio sotto l'albergo c'è un ristorante(Inoteca) “convenzionato” con l'albergo che se uno vuole si può far portare la cena in camera(non ve lo sconsiglio,i prezzi sono molto alti).All'inoteca si mangia cibo italiano,un po caro ma la pasta che abbiamo mangiato era buonissima.Sulla traversa,3rd Avenue potete trovare diversi ristoranti,pub e discopub per uscire la sera..Inoltre ci sono diverse tavole calde tipiche americane dove potete fare colazione all'americana!!Insomma Hotel consigliato, peccato che, per errore o ci hanno provato, mi hanno scalato circa 950 euro dalla carta,540 addebito reale dalla carta, altri cinque movimenti che non avevano nessun legame a me, abbediti strani di euro 50,poi 90,poi due da 132 euro, nonostante non avessi consumato nulla. State attenti, alla consegna della carta mi avevano detto che non mi avrebbero scalato nemmeno un dollaro, invece..Mi hanno reso, per fortuna prima della fine del mese così non sono andati a pagarli nell'estratto conto di Agosto, prima circa 520 euro, poi altri 20 euro il 17/09/2012. Ho contattato l'albergo per avere spiegazioni sui vari addebiti/congelamenti(che mi hanno fatto bloccare la carta e il conto!!!),ma ad oggi non mi hanno dato risposta,se non lo storno sulla carta.
L'albergo ha dimostrato di avere grossi problemi di gestione ed affidabilita', non mi era mai successa una cosa del genere, tra l'altro non hanno mai voluto spiegare l'accaduto, ne' di questo addebito ne' degli altri che poi non sono stati confermati..rimarrò con il dubbio. A mio parere ci avevano provato,ma mi sono accorto in tempo dell'addebito..Un'altra persona,tipo il mio babbo o il mio fratello non se ne sarebbero accorti. Mi raccomando, se andate al Marcel state attenti!!!
Avrei diverse foto belle dell'albergo,ma dopo quello che mi hanno combinato non ho nessuna voglia di fargli pubblicità!!!

"This specialty wine and cheese shop is everything it should be. I have never been when the owners weren't working, and they know their craft! You can walk in and browse the wine selection (they have everything from $13 bottles on up the ladder) or you can come in saying I'd like to find something to go with \""this\"" meal, or what kind of cheeses best compliment a Hefeweizen and they will know. And I mean they KNOW, it's not guessing, it is a wealth of knowledge and a love of the craft of small family run cheesemongers and an amazing taste for wines to pair (they also offer beer to if you're not in the wine mood). The best part, you tell them your price range for the wine and they will meet it.\n\nThe cheese isn't cheap. They come from family farms, and the owners know all there is to know about how each cheese was made. It is well worth it to buy 75% less than you would in the grocery store because you get 500% more flavor out of each bite! When requesting cheeses for pairing (or just to munch on) the owners ask what you're wanting and give you tastes of everything then they modify what they offer you based on your tastes.\n\nThe amazing cheeses paired with a bottle of wine and some good bread makes an evening of staying in watching a movie feel like a relaxed deluxe catered event.",positive,en

I wanted a refund, and they asked for my American bank's swift code to process such refund. I hung up to call my bank and retrieve it. I then called the airline back, and they said they could no longer refund me and they had sent a voucher for both me and my daughter. I was upset, but called again in September to book the flight and use the voucher for new year. The man I spoke to, booked my 5-day flight for us both, round trip and said I even had a $200 balance, since January is cheaper than the summer. I just checked and there is no scheduled flight and no credit or voucher. I spoke to another agent who said on his end, he can see the credit I have but it only covers the flight to Cancun, not the flight back, and I had a $100 balance, and that in order to fly back, I would have to pay an additional $300! I had already paid $600 back in the summer just for the flight.

"The exterior of the building might be unappealing but once you step in it's whimsical and cheerful. This is a Family Owned Sinaloan Style Seafood Restaurant that is open every day for lunch and dinner.\n\nRight away they gave us house made chips , the daily made green guacamole style salsa and the spicier red salsa. They are delicious and differ from other salsas I've tried elsewhere and I only tried a few and then they presented Mini Complementary Tostada Ceviches and gosh they were excellent and were better in taste (not quality of fish) than some I've tried at high end dinning destinations paying maybe the same as my whole meal here and these were FREE here. \n\nI always enjoy the fish veracruzana with vegetables but this time tried the fish with poblano peppers , onions and tomatoes. Both these dishes I can tell you are as tasty as can be. The fish filet is mild and fresh with a feather light batter that is not oily being the lightest batter I have ever seen on a delicate fresh fish. For me what makes these dishes so great is the delicious well made light sauces they are in. Also included are very soft fresh tasting tortillas and on the platter was salad , refried beans and a white rice with mixed vegetables that is yummy from the sauce of your dish. All this food I got was only $13.00 It was not good but very good.\n\nWhile we were dining I noticed most people were ordering what looked like a steaming large cauldron of mixed grilled meats and fish , I found out this dish is called Malcajete and it looked great to try.\n\nThey offer many variations of fish , steamed , grilled , battered, and breaded with a variety of sauces. Very little in the way of chicken or beef but they do have some.\n\nIt's a small family run business so when they get busy sometimes they go down a bit I noticed on a visit after I wrote this Yelp.\n\n3.5-5 stars",neutral,en

"We stayed three nights at the Hotel Chandler in March and had a great experience! We booked through Redtag and got a really good price. If you have the time and energy, it might be to your advantage to shop around because regular nightly rates are quite pricey in NYC.
CONSTRUCTION was taking place in the hotel lobby at the time, but it didn't affect our stay in any way. We never heard a thing when we were in our room. Upon completion (this summer I believe) they will offer a 70-seat restaurant and approximately 600 square feet of meeting space. That being said, during our entire stay, they compensated each guest with complimentary morning breakfasts and Wine & Cheese events from 5-7PM located in a suite on the second floor.
THE LOCATION was great (31st St and 5th Ave). Walking distance to the Empire State Building, Penn Station, Madison Square Park, Flatiron District, Grand Central, Times Square, etc... What's also wonderful is that even though you are near everything, it's a very quiet neighbourhood.
OUR SUPERIOR DOUBLE DOUBLE ROOM was very clean and looked exactly like the picture on their website. It wasn't very spacious (225 square feet) but for NYC, it’s a fair size. We had all that we needed: really comfortable beds, a flat screen TV, free Internet access, an iron and ironing board, an electronic safe and a mini-bar. If you have an iPod, you will really like their iPod docking station and radio. The view from our window was of the fire escape, which wasn’t very appealing, but our friends in another suite had a nicer view. NOTE: There are no coffee machines in the room, but we would just walk a few minutes and get our coffee at a nearby Starbucks.
OUR WASHROOM was clean. We really did appreciate the comfortable bathrobes and the Aveda products. The only thing that we didn't enjoy as much was the rainfall showerhead because if you wished to take a shower without being completely soaked from head to toe, it was close to impossible. TIP: If you absolutely need a bathtub, please contact Reception because not all suites have them. Ours didn't have one, but we didn't mind.
THE STAFF was fantastic! We felt at home the minute we stepped in. The staff was very courteous, friendly and attentive to our needs. When I thought that I had left a valuable item in the room (after check-out), a nice gentleman searched the entire room with me, to no avail, but it gave me peace of mind to know that I hadn't left anything behind before heading back home. The item in question was later found at another location.
PARKING was available for $40 per day. We didn't have any in-out parking privileges; they took our car at check-in and gave it back at check-out. Definitely not cheap but parking is a luxury in NYC. Anyhow, who really wants to drive in New York? If you can't walk to your destination, it's cheaper and less stressful to take the subway or a taxi.
We would definitely come back and would recommend Hotel Chandler for its location and wonderful staff.",positive,en

Oriental Cuisine이라고 되어있길래, 다양한 아시아 음식을 맛보길 기대하며 들어가 보았다. 내부는 좋게 말하면 왕가위 감독의 영화에 나올법한 분위기. 어두운 조도에 빨간 소파. 미국에 있는 중식당 느낌도 있고, 힙스터들이 좋아할 것 같은 분위기다. 음악도 시끌벅적한 힙합이다. 중국 어딘가에 있는 정육점 같은 느낌도 있다. 사실 식사를 편하게 할 분위기는 아니다. 식사를 하기보단 한 번쯤 경험해볼 분위기. 메뉴를 보니 중국 여러 지역의 음식이 있다. 아시아 여러 국가의 음식을 다루지는 않는 모양이다. 사천식 돼지고기튀김, 소고기 타면, XO 볶음밥을 먹었다. 사천식 돼지고기튀김은 적당히 매우 싹하고, 고추, 땅콩과 함께 먹었을 때 느껴지는 고소함과 매운맛의 조화가 좋다. 겉은 바삭하고, 속은 부드럽게 잘 튀겨졌다.소고기 타면은 육수를 잘 우려내 적당히 진해 육수의 풍미가 인상적이다. XO 볶음밥은 XO 장을 적당히 사용하여, 볶음밥의 고슬고슬한 식감과 XO 장의 은근한 풍미를 느끼기 좋다. 여러 메뉴를 맛보고 싶은 곳.",positive,ko

"My husband, handicapped brother, and myself stayed here for six nights a few weeks ago. This hotel worked very nice for us, since we used public transportation everywhere we went while on vacation. Front desk staff were always very helpful directing us to the correct bus stop. One right across the street, and the other one we used was about a block away. With these two stops, the bus took us to where ever we wanted to go including the Giants stadium, and to the subway to see an A's game in Oakland. Breakfast was at a little cafe next door, there were muffins, and coffee or juice. If you'd like more than that, there is a Safeway that the bus took us to, and we stored our
purchases in the in-room refrigerator (a nice surprise). Our room was cleaned each day of our stay, and everything was always in order when we returned after a day of sightseeing. All in all, this hotel/motel was very good for the price, and we would stay again if going to SF. Good restaurents, and a laundramat within a block of hotel also.",positive,en

"I dined last week with friends looking forward to what is marketed as 'KL's best fine dining restaurant'. Early for our reservation we made our way to the bar to have a drink while waiting. It took 5 mins for our drinks to come even though there were only 6 people in the bar including the two of us. Anyway, a slight delay I can forgive. When seated in the restaurant I have to say I was very impressed with both the interior and the menu. The food is what I would expect from such an expensive establishment. The attention however was not. I ordered first, speaking quite clearly but more importantly slowly so that everything was taken down. Was disappointed to find that two of my side orders did not accompany my steak and other side order. I had to ask twice for them to be brought to me. By that stage I had more or less finished my meal and was bitterly disappointed (even though the food was very good), that it had been brought out in drips and drabs. Still an impressive restaurant and would definitely recommend people visiting to try. It is a little overpriced though and given the lack of attention my order received I wouldn't really be in a rush back.",neutral,en

Since this restaurant out rated the usual I go, so let me give it a try. Ordered ayam ponteh, fried kangkung (asked to be non spicy so it was fried with garlic only), telur cincaluk and cendol. Ayam ponteh which is my favourite nyonya food is not well presented by them. The gravy is not smooth and not fragrant enough. Don't wan to comment kangkung because the flavour is not what they usually cook. The cendol cost rm5 per bowl. It's really a small bowl. Only telur cincaluk is accepted. There are better nyonya food out there, if you don't stay long at Melaka, probably could skip this.",neutral,en

"If you are looking for a genuine cowboy to teach you a thing or two on the dance floor this may be your best option within city limits. There is no flash or flair about this joint, but it delivers a good ole' country time.\n\nIt's been awhile since I have been to a place that charges a cover and has drinks in test tubes, but it all evened out with dollar beers before 10. Right when you walk in you notice the eclectic crowd, and I was for sure that this was going to be the night that I finally realized a lifelong dream to witness a dance off, but no such luck. \n \nDaisy Train, the live band consisting of a guy, girl duo was very engaging and played a good mix of \""couple\"" songs and \""dance in a group\"" music. Don't be scared of the dance floor when the 2 steppin' songs come on though, just make eye contact with one of the many cowboys huddled around the perimeter of the dance floor. I chose an older gentleman who knew something about boundaries, but you can have your choice of younger or older, taller or shorter. Just make sure to watch their style and level of attachment before you commit because you could be stuck with a cowboy that moves more like a chihuahua in heat. Didn't happen to me, but it's real and consider yourself warned!. \n\nDaisy Train does about 3 sets and while they take a break to wet their whistle, the DJ comes on and plays a mix of hip hop and group dancing favorites like the electric slide. My one complaint is that they had more than one disc that seemed to be skipping and didn't have good recovery time. \n\nBesides that though, there is plenty of space so come with a group, be prepared to dance with a couple of cowboys if you are so inclined to master the 2 step, and wear boots not heels. Overall, it t was a memorable night with a great group of ladies and one lucky guy. Thank you for the invite and insider info on how to spot a genuine cowboy, Ms. Dottsy!

"Note: This review is for the pizza (and mac and cheese!), since I'm not a (beef) burger eater.\n\nI came here in April with several friends before seeing a musical at the Byham. None of us had been here before, but we came here based on the convenience and the good reviews. I ordered the sweet Georgia Brown pizza, which has BBQ chicken, pineapple, red onion, and cheddar cheese. It had an interesting sweet-savory flavor profile, and a nice crispy texture. It was pretty good, as pizzas go, and definitely an interesting departure from typical pizza fare. I recommend it.\n\nOne of my friends ordered the shipwrecked burger, and found it delicious, if a bit over-the-top fatty. Another of my friends ordered the macaroni and cheese, per the waitress's recommendation, so I had to try it, as the resident mac and cheese connoisseur. I wasn't expecting to be impressed, but the sauce, which was on the milder side, was surprisingly creamy and well-seasoned, and complemented the tenderness of the shell pasta nicely (score: 9.0). If you go there, try it--this has to be the dark horse of mac and cheeses in PGH!\n\nThe atmosphere of this place is dark and kind of cave-like, with weird decor. Like another reviewer, between the place's logo, the decor, and the waitress's \""uniform,\"" I felt that it came off as trying a bit too hard to be hipster. It definitely has character--though I don't know if it's quite the right type. Service was fine--no problems there. Overall, an interesting place worth trying if you happen to be downtown.",neutral,en

"I had always wanted to try Fogo and I saw that they were on the list for AZ Restaurant Week so I made a reservation for 3 and never looked back. I arrived first and the rest of our party was running late so I was offered a seat at the bar and looked over the menu while my friends joined me. I was asked by staff passing a few times if I needed anything and was eventually brought out a basket of fresh bread while I waited. Once we were seated, our server gave us the run down and we made our way to the salad bar. It was sizable, but not as huge as I expected. Knowing what was ahead of me, I just sampled a few things, all of which were very fresh. I was more than ready to start with the meats. Lots and lots of meats everywhere you looked. My favorites were the parmesan crusted pork and garlic beef. The servers were very kind, offering numerous times to go back for a different cut or cook of meat if we wanted. The sides were also good, loved the mashed potatoes and crispy polenta. I do wish they had bigger containers of the sides as they were quickly gone. I had a caipirinha in the spirit of things, which was a great drink. We ended the meal with dessert, the cheesecake was rich and delicious. \n\nIt is definitely a special occasion type of place, but I would absolutely recommend it to others and will keep it on my short list for when I win the lotto :)",neutral,en

"C’est la confusion des sentiments pour Woody Allen, d’amour hésitant entre le feu d’une diva, la sécurité d’une mère ou la jeunesse d’une étudiante déjà éprise. C’est aussi le quotidien sous les sunlights, acteurs qu’on ménage, fans qu’on veut contenter, producteurs sûrs d’eux mais malgré tout pleins de doutes, smala familiale envahissante. C’est encore la culture juive omniprésente, et puis la paternité naissante : il y a sans doute en Marie-Christine Barreau et les deux bambins qu’elle trimbale le foyer que le cinéaste construit alors avec Diane Keaton. Et puis enfin, il y a le roi proclamé des arts, vénéré grand cinéma, jamais très loin derrière l’histoire du film. Noir et blanc évocateur, cadrages toujours inspirés, prouesses du montage et direction d’acteurs, tout se combine pour donner lieu à quelques scènes franchement splendides, comme celle montrant les questionnements silencieux devant son miroir d’une divine Charlotte Rampling. Plus encore qu’ailleurs dans sa filmographie, l’impression est forte d’assister à une psychanalyse de ce frêle newyorkais qui aura redéfini l’intellectualisme moderne.

"We stayed at the Hyatt for three nights for a weekend girls volleyball tournament.
The hotel looked very nice at the first sight, but the stay was not so pleasant for several reasons. The main one is that the rooms
are very noisy in that I could hear people talk and even snore in the next door room. Whenever someone talked in the hallway walking to their rooms, it sounded like they were standing right next to the door. In other words, the rooms are not well insulated from the outside noises. No noise came from the street, however, so windows are good. In the three days I did not have a single good night sleep.
Amother annoyance is that the Internet access was not free - $10 for 24 hours. This is crazy! It is free in a $40/night La Quinta. A bottle of water
in the room is $6.00, parking - $21 a night, breakfast - too expensive at about $20 with coffee. I did not feel like we were welcome there. Very disapointing.

There's not another Tropical Smoothie and I let her know. When she still refused to acknowledge my Groupon I asked to speak to a manager and she rolled her eyes and said she was the manager and she was not going to take my Groupon at all. I called Groupon and they had said there was a misprint on the Groupon and that I did go to the correct store. However I was too pissed to go back. \n\nCame back a month later with my guard up. I didn't need it, because that horrible woman wasn't there and apparently it was happy hour! The guy behind the counter convinced me to save my Groupon because my order was cheaper on happy hour.

"From the moment Christopher Lee puts on a pair of punk sunglasses and tries to sneak into a punk rock club, you know you've got a stinker on your hands! This film had potential. Beneath all of the sludge there are the remnants of what could have been crafted into a decent film, if not an interesting one. The final product is a real mess, however. Aside from the gratuitous nudity and some very attractive women, Howling II winds up being a laughable excuse for a horror film. Christopher Lee gives it a nugget of credibility, but even he cannot raise it above the level of crap.Having never seen any of the other films in this series, this critic will be forced to accept on face value that this is a genuine continuation of the events in part one. We start off at a funeral for one of the characters from the original, and within the first ten minutes we find ourselves in Transylvania with a small group of heroes ready to battle a coven of werewolves. The film is paced fairly well, and there are not too many dead spots. The action is there; it just isn't filmed well. One bright spot is the music of a punk band called Babel. Though their song is played quite often, it is rather catchy.The problems with this film are great in number. First off, the acting is worse than pitiful. Christopher Lee is good enough, but that's where it ends. The two leads Reb Brown and Annie McEnroe are lacking in just about everything you'd want for such characters. The writing is wretched, the editing redundant, and the direction amateurish. There are a couple nice special effect gimmicks, but the cheesy ones far out weigh them in number. Sybil Danning is nice to look at, but her acting performance is less than satisfactory. Judd Omen looks the part he plays, but his voice and acting are unconvincing to say the least. Much of the dialog is in an unintelligible language that may or may not be Latin.I liked the general idea for the story. I always enjoy stories of true believers out to battle seemingly invincible forces of evil. One scene where a small group of good guys are trekking through a dark forest and shooting down a bunch of werewolves is even kind of exciting. Kind of. Maybe a bigger budget or a better director could have made the rest of the film a bit more compelling. 3 of 10 stars.The Hound.Side note: As of this writing, the censors at youtube.com have still not taken down the ending credits with Sybil Danning ripping off her top several times while the Babel song is playing! Catch it while you can!",negative,en

"We chose this hotel largely because of the proximity to Minute Maid Park, and because it was very good value. I was not expecting anything much from it, it is a long time since we have stayed in an Embassy Suites, but I was really pleasantly surprised. The hotel lobby was as fancy as any upmarket hotel, and the room itself was impressive. The decor was modern and the furnishings were obviously new. There was a large living area, and a larger bedroom. We were on a high floor and had a great view.
We were to see the Astros and it was a really easy walk through a park. There was a festival of sorts on while we were there, and the place was buzzing with groups of children and parents all enjoying their day.
Breakfast was just okay for me, but I have no complaints.

"A very engaging documentary about Scottish artist Andy Goldsworthy, whose work consists mostly of ephemeral sculptures made from elements from nature. His work is made of rocks, leaves, grass, ice, etc., that gets blown away when the tide arrives at the beach or the wind blows at the field. Thus, most of Goldsworthy's works don't really last, except as photos or films of what they were. Now, one can argue that Goldsworthy's works are a reflection of mortality, or words to that effect, but isn't it easier to say that what he does is just beautiful art. And at a time when the stereotype about artists is that they are mostly bitter, pretentious, often mentally unstable people who live in decrepit urban settings, Goldsworthy seems to be the opposite: a stable, unpretentious, family oriented person who loves nature and lives in a small village in Scotland (of course, I'm sure those are the same reasons why he's shunned by some people on the art world who found his works fluffy or superficial).",positive,en
"The story: Young-goon is a girl whose family has a history of mental illness. She ends up in a mental institution after she starts believing that she is in fact a cyborg. In the institution she meets Park Il-sun, a young man who develops a bond with her.If you're reading this you probably already know how talented Chan-wook Park is. But 'I'm A Cyborg...' is a big departure from familiar, and (sadly) stronger territory. I'm a big fan of any film or story which is attempting to do something different. God knows, we all get subjected to enough crap at our local cinemas. The main point about the movie I need to say is, that it fails to say anything about mental illness, or create a characters that you care about.This story has to be one of the weirdest things I've seen in years...but weird isn't enough. There's no heart to the movie...just surrealism and confusion. Confusion does seem to be the main theme of the movie. The characters all try to make sense of their own problems, but it's Chan-wook Park himself who proves to be the most confused of them all.",negative,en
"This was just telecast here in the U.S. Others have commented on the faithfulness (or lack of same) to the novel; the 1983 BBC version is far superior on this and all other counts. Given the scope of the novel, it should not have been condensed to 85 minutes. Key sections have to be rushed or alluded to, or omitted; there barely enough time just to get in the chronology of events, so character development has to be sacrificed: we cannot get much of a sense of who the people are, which robs us of what makes Austen so great.One major negative for me was the cinematography, which I thought was just awful, and quite literally sickening. The camera is constantly doing ultra-closeups, and swirling around and around in circles. Maybe on a small TV box this is OK, but on our 40"" hi-def screen it was so literally dizzying that both my wife and I had to look away from the set repeatedly (my Dramamine supply had run out). Of course, this did distract from the rather lackluster I'm-just-reading-what's-in-the-script acting (isolated scenes are nicely done, but not enough to save things).Adding up the score so far in the Complete J.A. Sweepstakes: I'd rate ""Northanger Abbey"" a success, because of superior direction and production values (and the story lends itself better to short treatment), ""Persuasion"" OK (though not the equal of other versions, with condensation again being at fault), both far ahead of this attempt. I will hope for better in the two remaining novels in this TV Reader's Digest Jane Austen; like others, I am thankful they left P & P alone!",negative,en

"Not great, not bad.
When I first opened this item, it appeared to have been used and possibly a return unit. There was light scratching on the display and no protective film covering it, like most new devices with a display (this could be normal). I decided to test it out anyways. When I first plugged it into my van, it was having some issues, cycling between the battery indicator screen and regular display, without giving me any control. I plugged it into another outlet and after a couple minutes it began working properly. The display appears to have a slight defect as it is much brighter in the middle than it is on the right and left edges. My last disappointment isn’t a huge deal, and I wasn’t sure if this was a feature to begin with, but there is no file browsing system if you are using a micro SD card with music on it. This means it will simply start on the first song that is loaded onto it, and you can only skip forward and back from there. It isn’t all bad though. After I was able to control it, I was quickly able to pair my iPhone. All of the buttons seem to work properly and the sound quality with the device plugged into my system via AUX cable is surprisingly good. I have no intention of using the FM transmitter, so I did not test it. The design is simple and nice, and overall functionality is decent. Overall, this is not a bad product if you know what you’re receiving.",neutral,en

"The premise behind the story was very good and very quirkly, but the author's tone and style really turned me off, I'm sorry to say. Even though I understand and acknowledge the fact that modern-day (young) people don't suffer from being mealy-mouthed, I really would have liked this much better if every 3rd word hadn't been a 4-letter word. I'm really not exaggerating... I'm not exactly mealy-mouthed myself, but I can honestly say I've never seen the 's-word' or the 'f-word' used as so many different parts of speech (often in a single sentence) or with quite the abandon that these characters use them. I can tell that it's part of the characterization (the sole female character isn't quite as bad) but it's just overkill, plain and simple. My vocabulary includes a lot of synonyms or alternate phrases for those words, and a little variety might have gone a long way.As interesting as the premise was, I'd suggest giving this a pass unless you happen to like extremely limited vocabulary and forms of expression. Unfortunate, but it wasn't something that I could get past.",negative,en

"Celebrating the Husband's birthday (two months ago), we were looking for somewhere new that was children-friendly and had a variety of things to order. Bachi Burger was his place of choice. I called ahead to make reservations with our large party so that the table would be set up before we get there. \n\nOnce everyone was seated, and drink orders were in place, we got to break down the menu a bit. Since the Ronin Burger \""Caramelized Onions, Japanese Cole Slaw, Miso Goma, Dressing, Fried Egg, Katsu BBQ, Yuzu Citrus Aioli\"" ($8) got a lot of praise, the Husband split that along with the Kalbi Burger \""Ground Beef, Pork, Garlic, Ginger, Chili Paste, Green Onions, House Made Kim Chee, Ko Chu Jang Mayo ($8) with his friend. The Ronin was the favorite of the two he tried, enough that he ordered another to share. The cole slaw gave it a nice contrast and bite. Whereas the added kim chee to the Kalbi made it different. One thing that the Husband thought could be improved was the size of the burger. He felt they were a bit small, and one burger won't cut it for a growing man (even with fries).\n\nI started off with the Organic Edamame Soybean \""Sauteed with Garlic Butter, Truffle Oil\"" ($3) because who doesn't love a little truffle oil in their food. It was good, greasy, but definitely yummy! It's cooked in garlic butter, and I'm not used to cooking my edamame in any kind of butter!\n\nYou can't say no to their Truffle Parmesan Fries \""Parmesan Reggiano, Black Truffle Porcini Cream, Sun Dried Tomato Aioli\"" ($4). It comes in a nice cone with dipping sauce and it had all the kids grabbing some.\n\nAnother thing they do great is their Sweet Potato Fries \""Crispy Sweet Potato dusted with Sea Salt Yuzu Citrus Aioli\"" ($4). They are sweet, but salty and the dipping sauce complements it well.\n\nThe kids loved their Chili Fried Chicken \""Marinated in Ginger, galic, soy sauce.\"" ($6) that they ordered a second round.\n\nTo close out, we ordered the Portuguese Donuts \""Vietnamese Cinnamon, Coffee Gelato\"" ($5) with a birthday candle in it. (Sometimes restaurants throw in dessert for free when celebrating a birthday, it's not the case here.) They were donut holes with lots of cinnamon sugar on it. The accompanying gelato didn't taste like coffee much.\n\nService - we got the waiter that everyone talks about. He really does try, a bit too hard, and that's where he goes wrong. You can't blame the guy for trying, right? They could ultimately learn to work as a team though since we definitely had to wave down our waiter for things, and when we tried asking other staff for things, they just passed it on to our waiter. \n\nOverall, Bachi Burger definitely had some interesting takes on their version of meat between bread. There were some high points and okay points.\n \n3.5 stars",neutral,en

"As a disclaimer, I've seen the movie 5-6 times in the last 15 years, and I only just saw the musical this week. This allowed me to judge the movie without being tainted by what was or wasn't in the musical (however, it tainted me when I watched the musical :) ) I actually believe Michael Douglas worked quite well in that role, along with Kasey. I think her 'Let me dance for you scene' is one of the best parts of the movie, a worthwhile addition compared to the musical. The dancers and singing in the movie are much superior to the musical, as well as the cast which is at least 10 times bigger (easier to do in the movie of course). The decors, lighting, dancing, and singing are also much superior in the movie, which should be expected, and was indeed delivered. The songs that were in common with the musical are better done in the movie, the new ones are quite good ones, and the whole movie just delivers more than the musical in my opinion, especially compared to a musical which has few decors. The one bad point on the movie is the obvious cuts between the actors talking, and dubbed singers during the singing portions for some of the characters, but their dancing is impeccable, and the end product was more enjoyable than the musical",positive,en

"A block of rooms were held for my group and I was very happy with the hotel. I had a 1 bedroom suite non-smoking room on a corner and stayed for 7 nights. The rooms are great -almost a full kitchen with everything except an oven. The kitchen was furnished with place settings for two and about 3 different sized pots with lids. The refrigerator was full-size and the kitchen has a large sink and dishwasher. The maid washed dishes for me most of the days I was there. The kitchen was furnished with a kitchen dish towel- dish and hand, plus paper towels and D/W detergent. The living room was small but has a sofa bed couch and a chair with ottoman. The TV was an average size regular TV - probably a 25 inch. The separate bedroom was huge and had a large closet with wire shelving inside on one side. The bathroom was in the bedroom with the sink outside and the toilet and bathtub shower in a separate room to the side of the sink area. The sink has a large enough counter to lay things on. The bedroom has a desk with the TV on it. There is no light on the desk. There are two bedside table each with a lamp on either side of the King bed. The bed is very comfortable and I am a very picky sleeper and can't stand a very hard mattress. The pillows are overstuffed but I always travel with my own pillow. My sister came to stay with me the last weekend and slept on the couch. It is fairly comfortable, she said. One of the best features of this hotel is that a hot breakfast and hot dinner are provided each weekday. No dinner on Friday night or the weekend. The dinner was surprisingly decent in taste and quantity. I never had to buy breakfast or dinner during the week and saved my company money. There is a CVS Pharmacy close by that I walked to, that I was able to buy water and other items. The hotel also provides a buying service for free. I gave them a list in the morning of about 5 items and they were great, providing all of it. The hotel provides a listing of nearby restaurants. My sister and tried one of the restaurants (I think mediterranean) within 2 blocks and it was very good food. (Service was terrible.)
At the hotel, I had a couple of problems such as the coffee pot, DSL Internet cable,and one TV remote didn't work - but the hotel replaced all of them for me and comped one night of my stay for me after I complained of slow service too and two other problems. I had to return to DC in May and tried to stay at this hotel again, but there were no non-smoking rooms available so I had to stay elsewhere.

They then charged me $2.71 for a bottled wated that I didn't drink. I called to get this fixed and was accussed by the billing department that I drank the water and should be charged for it. After a bit of arguing, I hopefully got him to credit me back (I have yet to get the credit at the time of this review).
I can't believe all the reviews that this hotel is getting because it wasn't the greatest hotel for the price. The location is convenient for the downtown San Jose area but I would stay somewhere else for the price. Front desk staff was courteous but I didn't read reviews prior to my stay and wished I had asked for a quiet room.",negative,en

"Our stay was nothing less than CLASSY! The hotel is amazing, very clean and very personable and friendly staff! I booked through expedia and got a great rate, I was a little skeptical because some of the other reviews said that it was a timely check in process and so on... Totally not the case! We arrived about an hour early and within minutes was given our room key and permission to enter early! We had an amazing view, spacious room (corner rooms are def the way to go). From our king size amazingly heavenly bed we got fantastic views of the heart of boston. The prudential center was right out our window! We were celebrating my husband's 30th and it was a great choice! Very busy but still very relaxing, just as I would describe Boston! The hotel's restaurant's were pretty exspensive and a little to over the top so we took a stroll through the skywalks which are connected from the hotel all the way to a few blocks away! We ate breakfast and lunch at The Cheesecake Factory at the Prudential and it was delicious. There is so many nearby attractions and very conveinant shopping, even Shaws was step's away! This was great, I didnt have to buy 4.00 waters... I just went and grabbed a few 1.00 waters at Shaws! I love the night scene! All in All it was an amazing stay, amazing room, amazing service, and very fun! We can't wait to go back! So worth it! Thank You Westin Copley for making my husbands 30th Birthday getaway so special! P.s the heavenly shower and bed are both so very heavenly especially waking up to the scenery we did, totally felt like a mini pent house! <3",positive,en

"Love this place! I've been here twice - once for lunch and once for dinner - and it was superb both times. \n\nLunch - I had the lobster burger which, although its pricey at approx. $30, is almost all lobster and HUGE! The little crunchy potato twilles put on top adds a lot of texture. And I love that the burgers are served on little wooden platters. A+++. I also had a VERY spicy bloody mary - one of the best I've had in a while. Dessert - chocolate bar (which I would recommend for anyone; doesn't look like much but tastes like everything).\n\nDinner - Cheese puffs as an appetizer, which are little pastries with gruyere cheese. DELISH. I could've just eaten those and been a happy little lady. For an entree I had the crab burger, and I may have actually liked this better than the lobster burger. Again, another bloody mary, which was just as good as the previous one I tasted. For dessert, the cheesecake (which was great, nice, fluffy, filling); tried the celebration cake (a showstopper); and again the chocolate bar.\n\nAlso, this place has a HUGE wine list/cellars. \n\nAll in all, a definite \""hit\"" on any strip trip.",positive,en

"Positive: The area is beautiful. The surrounding area's scenery is lovely, and the landscape architecture at the resort is very well done. The rooms are spacious and comfortable, especially the beds. For the colder months, there are in-suite fireplaces.\n\nThe restaurant (Talavera) is delicious and the brunch offered on weekends is one of the best I have ever been to. The pool is fine and folks help set up the lounge chairs. Iced water, magazines, and sun block are available poolside as well.\n\nNegative: The biggest complaint I had with the resort was the number of loud children at the pool (including those under the care of the hotel's child-caretakers who brought the kids to the pool.) Mind you, I am a teacher, I love children, but on vacations I want to lounge by a quiet poolside. There is an adults-only pool, but after we moved from our \""cabana\"" in the young-and-old side, there were few seating options left at the adult-only pool, and you could still hear the noise. Not what I was expecting at a Four Seasons.\n\nThey charge $10 each night to park your car at the hotel (not valet, this is offered but at a greater charge). I could understand if the hotel was in a city, or in a town with many options for public transportation, but the only way to get from the airport to to the hotel, and around the area (most shopping and restaurants are a 15-30 minute drive from the hotel) is via car.\n\n**It is important to know that the hotel is spread out over a good distance, so to get from most rooms to the lobby, pool, and restaurants, one must walk a lot. Carts are available for guest transport, but there you may find yourself waiting a while for it to arrive.\n\nOlder guests or those with back/foot trouble may want to stay at the Phoenician where rooms are typically closer to the lobby/pool.",negative,en

"Hotel was picked by our Travel Agent, only saw Trip Advisor comments after booking made, first and last time we will make that mistake.
Following reading previous write-ups we requested and received a room upgrade from double to twin, many thanks to the Paramount staff for that. However the room was still very cramped and tight. Also part of the way through the week we stayed a group of Students were booked into the rooms around ours, as you would expect the parties started straight away in their rooms and the corridor. Needless to say the noise was bad. Security responded and calmed the youngsters down once we and other complained.
With regards to the room generally there was little cupboard space. Shower Room was small and cramped. We were disappointed that there were no coffee and tea making facilities. The maid service was good with the room maintained in a good clean condition. However the view was of a brick wall and razor wire. The hallways and lifts where dimly lit making for a very depressing aspect and caused some difficulty in identifying our room number. Not sure if this was meant to add to the ambiance or to hid the rather shabby decor.
There is a large selection of Restaurants and diners around the Hotel. The Restaurant and Cafe in the Hotel are pricy, however we found the cafe pleasant for a quick cupper. However we would recommend the dining options in the Edison a few doors along the street. Hotel location is great with all the excitement of Times Square and the theatres very close by. However overall off our group staying at various Times Square Hotels, with similar prices, agreed that the Paramount was very disappointing and found it hard to agree with a four star rating.",negative,en

"So after being an honest customer for six months and never having gone anywhere else to have anything done to my nails or toes I can give a truly fair review. \n\nTruthfully, I am only continuing to go back to get rid of all the credit on my account. Every single time I've gone to get a gel manicure it lasts ONE WEEK before chipping now (it used to last up to a month) and that could possibly be because I've gone for so long with their several gel coats that my nails are becoming weaker OR because their technicians aren't paid or treated well so they likely don't care anymore. Anytime I call to make an appointment I can't change my mind when I get there about a design because they won't have the time. I kid you not after I had a gel coat put on I decided I wanted glitter on two fingers and was told by the technician that she didn't have time sorry. Okay. People don't change their minds ever?\n\nFinally the last straw that made me really decide that I need a new salon, I had an appointment today at 10am right when the salon opened but I ended up sleeping through my alarm because I got called in for a late shift at work. I called the salon as soon as I woke up (11:40am) to make another appointment. After I made the appointment the girl said \""due to your no show history I will need a 50% deposit to hold your appointment\"" HAHA is that a freaking joke? I've been coming to you guys for a solid 6 months and missed ONE appointment suddenly that qualifies me for \""history.\"" AND the appointment was right at 10am when you open so could easily schedule another appointment or accommodate a walk in?

"I traveled as part of a business group of 200 during this stay. I had some preconceived expectations based on previous business trips and was surprised that this property was not in the same category. It made me reflect that perhaps this resort was chosen due to the current economic situation.
I checked in early (11am) and had no problems with lines or getting a key to my room. The rooms were outdated, but not unclean. However I had issues with general room maintenance. E.g. Toilet handle was broken. A call to front desk resolved that. Shower did not drain. A call to front desk did not resolve it day one but a second call day two did finally fix it. TV's/remotes were old. Couches in suite area were saggy. While the suite had the makings of a good room it was in need of a makeover. Wireless was provided free in the room as part of the business package. Note that the walls/doors are thin. I could hear the family next door perfectly (like they were my own). And, there were many meal events held direcly outside of my bedroom and setup began at 6am or earlier and you could hear them rolling the tables, heat lamps/etc in the morning and tearing down after 11pm at night. The resort didn't offer the type of serenity I was expecting.
At 12pm I met colleagues in the lobby and we sat on the patio and had lunch. The service was slow but the food good. We split a Cobb salad and a pizza. The portions were large.
From there we went to the spa. I thought they did wonderful job with the gym setup. While the spa waiting room wasn't luxurious, they did serve fresh fruit and tea/water. My massage was fantastic - probably the best I ever had given by an Italian named M. I did not use the water park or the golf course. We did try other restaurants and the service was pretty much the same - slow and uneventful.
As far as the conference space, it was not top notch. There were issues with audio quality throughout all the rooms. The worst was the general sessions. There was lots of back noise making it difficult to hear the presenters. Additionally there was not enough space/rooms to accommodate all the breakouts, but that is not the resort's fault.
This resort would not be on my list of places to return to, but I could see why families would find it to be a good, economical choice.",negative,en

"Great service and incredible food! We wound up here for a business dinner without a reservation and were really surprised that this place wasn't packed. \n\nOur entire party was pleased with the quality of food we got. We started with the tempura ice fish and the beef roll with enoki mushroom. Both were spectacular (although how can a pile of little fried fish be anything but?). Everyone ordered their own entree and didn't really share, but for me, the steamed sea bass on tofu was a great follow up to the heavier appetizers. The sauce sufficiently allowed the sea bass to shine through. The fish itself was perfectly flaky. The tofu added more substance to the dish while not making it heavy. Can't think of any way to improve this one! \n\nThe service was also impeccable. We were never waiting for drinks and the waiter was always right there if we had a question or wanted to order something. Even though he was very attentive, he didn't hover. \n\nAll in all, a great experience and a pleasant surprise.

"This was by far the most frustrating hotel stay I have ever experienced. My fiancé and I traveled to Philadelphia from DC to celebrate our engagement. We were excited because we had heard great things about the Loews Chain of Hotels and it was our top choice to have our wedding reception there.
The first incident began upon arrival at 4:10 pm, when we went to check in we were told that there were no clean king rooms, but there were rooms with two double beds available. We paid for a king, so we said we would wait. We then proceeded to wait over an hour before the room was ready. After being slightly perturbed, we decided to brush it off and go up to our room and get ready for dinner.
After being in the room for 15 minutes, a maid knocked once and promptly opened the door and got a clear view of my fiancé changing. The housekeeper explained that the room had not been cleaned and she was told to clean it. This made us question 1.) The security of the room (the dead bolt was latched) and 2.) The cleanliness of the room (and if in fact we were staying in a clean room). I decided to call the front desk where I voiced my concerns, (after being told that simply putting the do not disturb sign out would prevent future intrusions) I was told that we would be receiving a complementary bottle of champagne and strawberries sent up to our room. 50 minutes passed of sitting in our room before I decided to call back down when I asked to speak to Marcus (the manager I had originally spoke to), I was told that he was not “available” (after being on hold for 5 minutes). I was then informed that he would make sure we received the champagne and that we would get a call back. Another hour passed with no champagne and no call. I decided to call down and say that we were leaving for dinner because we were late now for our reservations and that we would deal with this later.
We left had a great dinner at Morton’s and came back in good spirits despite the earlier incidents. We then decided before we turned in to check-in with the front desk to try and get some clarity on the status of our champagne. We respectfully voiced our concerns to an individual at the front desk who told us that the champagne had been delivered to our room and that “Josh” had left a note that our room would be complimentary due to the earlier incidents. I asked the individual for some contact information or a printed confirmation that our room would be free (I booked through a third party website so I could not get the refund on-site). I agreed that I would go through the appropriate channels to get the refund, but again simply wanted confirmation that this would in fact happen. The situation quickly escalated when the flustered employee decided to call Jessica (the night manager) to deal with the situation. My fiancé at this point was quite upset that we could not get a simple piece of paper assuring us that we could get a refund. Our reasonable frustration logically escalated and prompted a pompous security guard (void of any coping mechanisms or tact) to inform a crying five foot tall female that we had two options either go up to our room and take the “algid” free room or get kicked out… Yes, get kicked out for sensibly voicing our concerns about not being able to get a piece of paper with a name and a number on it.
This was the most exhausting and taxing experience I have ever dealt with in a hotel or any customer service environment. We spent our entire trip not relaxing or talking about our upcoming wedding, but instead talking about the way we were treated by the employees and the downright ridiculousness of all of the situations we encountered while at the Loews. I realize this is a service industry and there are a lot of difficulties and annoyances that staff deals with. We never asked for any of the items the staff offered: I did not request a bottle of champagne or a free room, but when I am told I will be receiving them I expect to receive them and in a curious and timely manner.
I have never seen such an arrogant and argumentative customer service model. I ask for just the basics in a hotel and I spend my money to be treated like a “guest”. I felt like I was in line at the DMV for all of 20 hours I spent at the Loews Hotel. I kept putting myself in the shoes of one of our wedding guests and imagining if they went through a fraction of what we did, how awful I would feel. I am sure I will never see a cent of the refund and we will certainly be having our wedding reception elsewhere.",negative,en

"My kids recently started watching the reruns of this show - both the early episodes on the N, and the later ones on ABC Family - and they love it. (I wasn't aware the show had even lasted past the first or second season) I'm curious as to what prompted all of the cast changes - I've seen them described as ""highly publicized,"" and yet a half hours searching efforts on the web have revealed nothing but endless comments on how the early episodes were so much better than the later episodes. (Personally, I don't see a whole lot of difference - the scripts and themes remain largely the same throughout - but they do lose some great people along the way) My daughter has put the DVDs on her wish list, so perhaps the land of special features and commentary will shed some light on all of this. I also wish they'd done some self-referential humor about the changes - like on ""Boy Meets World"" where they drop the little sister for an entire season or so, and when a different actor later shows up playing her, they ask her where she's been and she says ""upstairs,"" or when early series token geek ""Minkus"" shows up for the high school graduation, they ask him where he's been and he says ""over there,"" pointing to the part of the classroom never shown by the camera, before saying ""Hey, Mr. Turner, wait up!"" and running off screen (Mr. turner being another character who left) Oh well - maybe there will be an E true Hollywood story on this or something? I was just glad to see Aunt Hilda show up for the finale - she was always one of my favorites - it's too bad it couldn't have been a more encompassing cast reunion.

"It has been a tradition since my first VHS recorder for me to collect several of the incarnations of the old chestnut by Charles Dickens, and I taped this one and ""Karroll's Christmas"" this year. Fortunately, when this one was run on the Hallmark Channel at the unGodly hour of 3 AM, I was spared having to edit commercials from it. This was, however, it's only saving grace. The writing was excruciatingly dull with almost no clever scenes to save it from being anything more than a teeny-bopper soaper like Beverly Hills 90210. In this one, a good man who was cast aside for her celebrity seems the only logical explanation for her transformation into a Scrooge-like TV talk show hostess. It wasted Dinah Manoff who just plays bitch goddess to the other bitch goddess Tori Spelling (who, by the way, had more coats of paint on her face than some colonial houses) and Bill Shatner is perhaps one of the few fun things in this otherwise dreary adaptation. Some of the best opportunities are wasted like the entrances of the ghosts. Aunt Marla's entrance could have been spectacularly funny in the hands of a decent writer, but this Christmas turkey didn't have one, evidently.Tori Spelling may be a lovely person, but she has all the acting skill of a mannequin, and that makes for a bad show all by itself. Yes, it was good to see Gary Coleman work again, but the script gives him nothing to do really except roll his eyes and spout truly lame dialogue.And what is most infuriating was that the transformation from Scroogedom to Tori ""sweet and light"" is as convincing as a passionate conservative. Now, if anyone wants to write the ultimate Scrooge tale of a George Bush and Karl Rove, we might have a refreshing change from the usual bad Christmas Carol Clones.I suppose if you're a fan of Ms. Spelling and/or 90210, this might be your cup of Christmas cheer. I'd prefer a stiff shot of scotch and a cold beer to wash it down myself. This one I just may cast away before it is with me here for a long long time.God save us everyone!",negative,en

"VDM GALLERIE CAFENice and cosy place. We were out of luck because 3 items we ordered weren't available. So either business was too good or perhaps they've offered too much variety in their menu that makes proper menu planning/mise en place a bit messy. Either way, it was 12.30 nn so unavailable item on the menu isn't really good news, especially for first timers.However, they have an interesting mix of menu items that caught my attention. Mostly western and some fusion. There's just so much to choose from. Nice food presentation too.We finally settled with the chicken chop and some 'onigiri-like' mixed grain rice ball with stir fried beans and mushrooms. Chicken chop cleverly flattened to ensure that it's evenly cooked with light, crispy skin and tender meat. (My guess: grilled skin down under low heat?). Served with black pepper sauce on the side and fried fries, fruits, an egg, bun and salad greens. Loved the fact that it's simple and just lightly seasoned. The rice balls were good although I think pairing it (mixed grain rice) with only stirfried veges (pretty good) seems a bit dry and plain. Perhaps they should consider adding some seasoned kombu(my fave!), or whatever filling like what the Japanese do with the onigiri. It makes the rice more appetizing. If they wanna keep it Chinese , how about a bit of preserved olive leaves as filling? Just my opinion anyway. I do think the price is a bit pricey for something this plain. Beverage: appreciate the fact that the drinks weren't too sweet. Overall, the cafe is cosy, and clean. Nice decor too. You need to take your shoes off at the entrance. Notes: While the tables and everything else is clean, attention to details in terms of serving gears and plates is needed. My iced coffee was served on a rectangular wooden tray that looked like it's been wet for too long and turned black and moldy(see pix). Not cool. The handles of the knives were sorta blackish . The spoon in my iced coffee was shorter than the glass(see attached video). The spoon used to spoon out the cincau jelly cubes could barely scoop anything. It was a hard chore trying to eat the cincau jellies (and nope, can't get through the straw too) so we ended up pouring the last 1/3 cup of the longan -cincau drink into my finished iced coffee glass. One more thing, if you are hungry or in a hurry, you may want to think twice. Otherwise, this is a nice place for a leisurely meal. Parking, (at this moment ) can be a problem.

"When we arrive at the front of the Hotel, we were slightly confused. Where is the doorman or bellmen to assist with guest checking in? ..then we noticed to the left of the building was a single automobile entry way indicating to pull in for Hyatt parking. The guest reception is on the side of building rather than main front entrance. The Lobby itself was small in comparison to other Hyatt Hotels, behind the 6 feet wide reception counter were two ladies, very friendly and professional. We were staying only one night and was informed we could upgrade to a patio room for additional charge....so we took to room upgrade.
It is a spacious room had features to accomodate the disabled but it had a set of stairs that leads up to outdoor patio? Oh yes..the patio we paid as an upgrade. The patio had a rattan sofa, no smoking allow, no view at all, totally enclosed by walls and frosted glass BUT the people walking down the stair case from the upper floors has full view of our patio. Bad choice of upgrade.
The two double beds were comfortable but the housekeeping was poor. The shiny surface of the headboards were filthy, the two armchairs in the room were a bit dingy, there was a spot of dried pink foam left on the bath counter. Oh..and the bathtub curtains were NOT waterproof even with the lining secured inside tub, each time one of us took a shower water dripped heavy outside onto the floor.
This hotel has the ""older"" feel and both of my teenage kids felt a bit spooked by it. In my opinion, the Hyatt at Bellevue needs an update (was later told by check-out staff the update is in progress although I didn't see evidence in either hallways or lobby). I gave this hotel 3 stars because the reception staff and the bellmen were very professional, also they were kind enough to reverse the patio upgrade charge due to displeasure.
Overall, the pros were spacious room, great location and the availability of self parking. We paid over $300 (including taxes and parking) for a single night stay without the upgrade fee. Due to the older style of this hotel and the lack of value, we will not be revisiting this Hyatt.",neutral,en

"We stayed here for a large event at the end of June. You would think that a large Hilton chain hotel would be experienced at dealing with city-wide events with hotel rooms being at full capacity for 2 weeks straight, but not so. We arrived to find extremely long check in lines and only 1elevator for the 9 story hotel. Once we did manage to get our room, it was occupied, so we were given another room. This one was smoking, which we explicitly requested against. The manager stated that there were no other rooms left, which we later found wasn't true, but it would require some customer service time, which wasn't the priority. After multiple ""discussions"" we managed to be moved the next day, however, no compensation was offered for the night in the smelly room. Once we did manage to settle in, the room was nice and spacious, with upgraded amenities and decent beds. The one bright spot was the stellar workout room at the Capital Club adjacent to the hotel. The only way I would stay again would be during a quiet period in the city (in Columbus by OSU this never happens) where I was guaranteed a non smoking room.

"This is pretty much the first Jason Scott Lee film I've seen. I say pretty much, because I have also seen Soldier, in which he plays the villain... but from what I've heard, it's not considered a Jason Scott Lee film. This, however, is. And if this is any indication of the quality of such films, I won't be seeing any of the others. Lee is basically passable as a martial arts artist... as the lead, he's awful. He gets in a fight with random no-name characters every few minutes of the film, probably because the script writer couldn't figure out how else to stretch out the film to the minimum required running time for a feature film. The villain is the only character with even a hint of personality, and aside from the fact that he's certifiably insane, he barely seems like a villain at all. The majority of the film is basically Lee chasing the villain through time... or maybe it's the other way around. I can't say for sure... and I definitely wouldn't watch it again to make sure. The effects are not completely horrible... but it's close. The title comes from the popular idea of using a time-machine to go and kill Hitler. Somehow, the film screws up that interesting idea as well. The plot is too complicated for its own good. The pacing is poor. I can't think of one positive thing to say about this film... I really can't. It's simply too formulaic and pointless. If only I had a time-machine, so I could go back and prevent this film from ever being made... no, never mind. I just hope as few fragile minds are exposed to this as possible. Listen to the negative reviewers. Avoid this turkey. I recommend this to fans of Lee, and no one else. If you're looking for a quality film... well, this isn't it. That's for sure. 1/10",negative,en

"I had the great luck to be directed to this hotel by a nearby hotel that was full. Such a nice place! After spending the day helping a friend move from Portland,we arrived to our room after 11pm, exhausted. Didn't even realize we had been up-graded to a king suite until we checked out next morning. Lovely, big room, with 2 tvs and a fireplace, 3rd floor over looking 1st street. It was Saturday night, and, yes it was a bit noisy, there is tons of nightlife nearby. But the street did quite down by 1-2 am and I enjoy the people watching. AM coffee in the lobby was good. Love the pets we met in the lobby. No pet odor in the halls or room. Only complaints, very minor, were: the bedside clock has a blinking hotel ad on it...annoying, had to cover it. The feather pillows were the thinnest I have ever felt, and the firm pillows were gigantic. Lastly, it turns out I dislike rainshower shower heads, it would be nice to add a hand held, too, as the water pressure seemed pretty low. Positive note, the sheets were the softest I have ever slept on and check out time is noon, which is a treat.

It worked out very well for us to cross the street and pick up our Budget car rental when we were ready to check out. I would definitely go there again for the friendly staff and the airport location.",negative,en

"I came here on the first day that i noticed this place was open. The restaurant seems unfinished with only a counter to eat at and open space at the front. i think it's fair to assume that the void will soon be filled with additional seating.\n\nWhat impressed me most was the fast service. In Oakland, a neighborhood filled with fast food, it's surprising how much of the food is just junk food - not fast. It took them about 4 minutes to make a gyro which is about half the time it takes for the nearby Kebab Factory. Furthermore, the prices are on par or less than the prices for other sandwiches and wraps in the area.\n\nFood wise, I had a gyro sandwich with an olive pastry on the side. I enjoyed everything except the lamb doner meat which lacked seasoning and was mildly cold). The pastry tasted like a croissant that was filled with black olives. The tzatziki sauce had an interesting taste seemed to be subtly influenced by olives.\n\nIn conclusion, I'm likely to return once Forbes Gyros has more experience.",negative,en

"We stayed at the Shoreham for three nights in August. Upon check-in, we were informed that the hotel did not have our reservation. We provided our confirmation number and documentation to show that we had reserved a room and were re-booked another - the staff person was unapologetic and of course, there was no room ready for us so we had to wait a few hours for one to become ready. We checked our bags with the concierge and came back a few hours later (took a leisurely stroll in Central Park, which is close by). When we returned, it took about 20-30 minutes to check-in. There was only one staff person at the front-desk and they were doing 3 jobs at once (Checking people in, answering the phone, and fielding requests from other guests). We finally got to our (standard) room - it was small (but worked well for two people and was what we expected for New York), tidy but not super clean (e.g., belongings of the previous guest were left in some of the drawers). Due to the hotel's error (losing our reservation) - the room we were given did not have the amenities promised when we made our initial booking (e.g., massage chair). After re-iterating these errors (room amenities, lost reservation, etc...) to the front-desk staff, the person made no attempt to accommodate us and basically told us to ""that nothing could be done"". In spite of this, the rest of our stay here was okay - except for the last day. When we woke up, we found a letter slipped under our door stating that there would be no hot water running that morning...just wonderful... After checking out, we once again left our bags with the concierge and went about our day before leaving for the airport. But the fun doesn't stop there... Approximately 2 weeks after our stay, we received a rogue credit card charge from the Shoreham for some unexplained reason. We called the hotel several times - The staff could not explain the additional charge. We were also hung up on (albeit, possibly an accident, although the person we talked to didn't seem to care that this happened - no attempt to call back, no apology once we called back etc...) and were told to call back later in the day to speak to a manager (e.g. this happened twice). I don't think that this hotel even has a manager on duty - each time we called there was not one available (during business hours) and never got a response (after one week) from e-mailing the person... still trying to resolve the issue...
Summary ...
- Location-wise, the hotel is central to many attractions.
- Coffee machine in the lobby is a nice perk
- Staff were ambivalent and need customer service training (This is clear from many of the other reviews on Trip Advisor as well).
- Unauthorized charges after our vacation is complete, not being able to provide a clear response, and having to chase after the hotel after the fact is a big no-no and not worth the headaches. In fact there are several reviews on Trip Advisor that show similar fraudulent charges being made by the Shoreham hotel to its customers.
- In the end, pass on this hotel and choose one of the many others in Manhattan",positive,en

"I'm teetering between 3 and 4 stars, but I'm going with 4 stars because *I* had a great time, even though some of my friends didn't have such a great experience. Additionally, I visited Commonwealth on the night of First Friday, so I think things might be different at other times/days. \n\nTo the review! \nIf you're going to visit Commonwealth on a busy night (holiday weekend, First Friday, etc), get there early!! We arrived around 10p, and while there was a line to get in, it wasn't too long, maybe 5-10 minutes. It was busy, but not overly crowded. The space, as others have mentioned, is beautiful. Just a gorgeous bar. We didn't get anything fancy as far as drinks go (sadly), but what we did get was fine. Slightly overpriced for downtown. \n\nHeading upstairs- I thought this was just as cool. A rooftop lounge/bar/dance floor. I felt like I was in another city! There was table service, and they were letting people sit at the unsold areas until they were purchased. The DJ was fantastic, people were dancing, and it was just lots of fun. Unfortunately, as the night went on, things started to go downhill. By 11, the line outside was getting crazy long, and we stupidly went downstairs. We had quite a long wait to get back upstairs because they were full to capacity, unless you had a wristband (?) or had a table. We luckily made it back up when a large party left, but some of our other friends weren't so lucky. Downstairs was pretty unbearable by midnight- I don't know how people ever got a drink because it was so crowded. Even upstairs, it took forever. \n\nI'll be back, but definitely would advise to make this an early stop on your Downtown adventures, or to go during the week (and not on First Friday!)",neutral,en

"By far the worst flying experience of my 45 years. The first flight from O Hare was canceled after multiple delays, and they finally agreed to reroute me through a city 200 miles from there! Since I was expected at my destination, I took it. 2nd leg had a slight delay also, but I got there 24 hours after expected. 2. Flight back had 2 legs as well. 1st leg again delayed. No mention of 2nd leg was made by staff, but the layover time was enough that I made it. Or so I thought. The flight from Atlanta, which was supposed to be at 10:27 PM, was announced as delayed to 11:20 PM. OK, I thought. No biggie. At 10 PM, they announced it was delayed to 2 AM because they didn't have staff. Here's the kicker. If they found staff, they would leave earlier. So passengers couldn't move from the gate. No meal vouchers for this 4 hour delay. Clock kept ticking. 12:30 AM, I went to get some coffee. Came back. The board at the gate says departure at 12:25 AM. All passengers were still waiting, but I panicked and asked the agent, and he says, sorry, mistake. It's at 2 AM. Then, all gate agents left. 1 AM, 1:30 AM, 2 AM... 100-plus passengers are at the gate desk, calling out for someone to come and update us. I started talking to their online agent. No customer service telephone line. It takes 15 minutes to get one online. He closed the chat unexpectedly. Ok, let's say it was an accident, but given their behavior this far you get the point. I try again. It takes 10 minutes. The agent says all their systems are down, and she can't tell me what's happening with my reservation. I tell her, I'm asking for flight status. Surely, you have that. Or air traffic control would have something to say. She keeps repeating all systems are down, and she cannot tell me more. I ask for a supervisor. She won't get me one. 3:15 AM, someone shows up at the gate desk and says they're just waiting for pilot. Passengers are really panicking by now and asking why we aren't being kept informed. The 2 agents who came out smirk at the crowd and say they don't have to let any of us fly. They say the pilots have to wait out the time before they can fly again and ask all of us to move to a different gate. Okay, passengers agree, and we walk. 3:27 AM, I get a text saying flight is at 3:30 AM. Then, gate agents leave again from the new gate. They come back around 4 and say flight canceled. We can go to ticketing counter to get refund or reschedule. Oh, you also have to get your checked in luggage. If you know Atlanta airport. I get my luggage and go to the ticketing counter all the way at the terminal entrance. Huge lines. They say next flight to anywhere in Illinois will be in 2 to 3 days. At that point, I ask how much will I be refunded, because another ticket booked with another airline for just that short leg would cost 3 times as much. Answer is: I don't know. If I choose to stay (at the expense of 2 lost vacation days), will I have hotel covered? Yes, but meal and hotel won't happen until 3 PM. Remember this is now 5 AM for a 10:27 PM flight, and all passengers have been awake through the night because of their stupid conditions. Eventually, I book tickets on United and decide to eat the loss.",negative,en

"Stayed at the Intercontinental Austin for a few nights for a leisure trip. Overall, the Intercontinetal was fine, nothing to complain about but nothing extraordinary either. I would stay here again if the price was right, but otherwise, I'd look elsewhere.
Check-in was a bit slow and certainly not overall welcoming. We had three rooms booked and they NEVER got the billing situation worked out despite a couple of visits.
Rooms were okay if a bit small. Everything felt a bit cramped, especially the bathroom. Room was very clean and daily service was very good. Beds were too soft. If you've gotten used to the heavenly beds at Westin, these will disappoint.Breakfast at the hotel restaurant was very nice. Location would be hard to beat if you want to explore Austin. Concierge was not particularly informative but always helpful.

"Cartel has been my go-to coffee house for single origin espresso and pour over, however as of late - I feel that the customer service has declined. \n\nLet me clarify: The last 3 times I have been to Cartel, the line was not long, there was not a stack of drink orders to complete, and employees were not incredibly busy -- however my wife and I had to wait at the register for at least a minute or more while employees converse with each other or a group of girls that caught their attention (in fact - the girls pointed out to the barista that we were waiting before he turned to acknowledge us), the baristas failed to make eye contact or conversation with me or my wife during the coffee making process or after (not even the usual \""how was your espresso?\"" or even \""Hello, here's your drink\"" ), and the overall wait times were excessive for 2 out of 3 of our last visits (just over 20 minutes for a clever coffee brew - 2 orders in front of us - baristas chatting with 2 customers and ignoring others). \n\nThis does not taint my view of Cartel of a great place to get a quality cup of coffee - but when a barista under-extracts the espresso, hands it off without eye contact, and walks out of frame before you can mention the tart, thin tasting beverage - Cartel risks losing consistency which is just as important as quality. I don't want to gamble my time and taste-buds for an artisan beverage without a guarantee it will taste good and arrive in a reasonable amount of time.\n\nThe great service provided by Seth, Jeff and the girls that worked there over a year ago seems to be diminishing with the increasing size of the location and additional beverage responsibilities that the new baristas have. I hope they turn it around because I find myself defaulting to less tasty coffee options due to expected consistency and customer service. Cartel is not a 'rush-in-to-grab-a-quick-cup-and-speed-to-work' coffee house, but when I want to sit down and enjoy an Americano, I do expect some small level of interaction and consistency with the baristas making my drink.",neutral,en

"I would not reccomend this hotel because my husband and I found bed bugs. First, we noticed them in the cracks of the walls. Then, I tore off the mattress cover and saw an infestation of them in the seams on both beds. We asked for a room switch after telling the problem to the front desk. They were very 'hush hush' about it, and agreed to change our room. We were given no discount or courtesy credit, which was I didn't think was the mark of a good business. They acted like they'd never experienced that problem before, but I doubt it by the way they were behaving. Our second room was noisy, the light in the bathroom had an overbearing buzz and the traffic outside was awful, even with our windows closed. We might as well have been sleeping on the streets. Also, this hotel would not be good for anyone with walking problems, as there is no elevator! If you get a room on the fourth floor and you have a lot of luggage, you must walk it up yourself.

I get that the toenail is a smaller surface to work on but there is no reason to lie to get me in the chair. My toes look great.

"I kind of have a love hate relationship with US Airways. I have always found their staff to be extremely kind and helpful. I especially appreciate how patient they have been with me the many times I have found myself running late, or without a seat assignment. That along with the great prices I have gotten on my tickets give them 2 stars. \n\nNow here is where my strong dislike for them comes in- almost every flight I have been on, I've been bumped. They do give me a voucher to put towards a flight in the future but it doesn't fully make up for the 5 extra hours you have to spend in the airport or missing your birthday dinner you had planned at your final destination. The cleanliness of the plane is questionable. Many times I have gotten to my seat to find trash. I don't know about you but I strongly dislike having to pick up after the person who was in my seat previously. Then, the over all care for the interior is lacking. So often I have found myself on a seat that was torn or the seat wouldn't recline. \n\nI guess for me with flying its the little things that make a difference. It's already uncomfortable flying, the last thing I want to do is sit somewhere that adds to the discomfort of flying through the air.",negative,en

"I put my mother up at this ""4-star"", $317/night Hyatt property for 3 nights in July. The furniture in the room was shabby (ie, dilapidated - not ""shabby chic""), the concierge literally could not offer a single suggestion for a winery to visit for a day-trip to Sonoma (or bother to try finding one) or even provide a printed map of the city's iconic 49-mile scenic drive, and one night the lobby staff completely ignored the fact that a woman stumbling around the lobby was so drunk she could not stand nor even recognize where she was. When I relayed this info via the guest feedback request I received after the stay, I received a nonsensical reply from an assistant manager stating that the employees who sit behind the concierge desk wearing Hyatt uniforms and name tags are actually 3rd party contractors, not Hyatt employees...as if that makes any difference to a guest or justifies their ""4 star"" rating and $300+/night room rates.

"1981's Just Before Dawn is one of the best tales of wilderness horror out there. It's one of the finest-made slashers of the 80's and it easily blows movies like The Final Terror, Don't Go in the Woods, or The Prey out of the water.A group of young adults come to check out the mountain property that one of the group has just bought. However they are not alone in the wild. A hulking in-bred murderer, who seems to be in two places at once, is lurking and apparently hates trespassers. Director Lieberman, who gave us such great B films as Squirm (1976) and Blue Sunshine (1977), does an excellent job with this smart thriller as well. The movie is nicely atmospheric, with a creeping sense of tension and some strong suspense. This film makes even the open wilderness seem frighteningly claustrophobic. The Oregon locations are beautiful and well captured by the crafty cinematography. The music score is a true original and awesome in contrast with the scenic visuals. Deborah Benson makes for a great lead, her presence was captivating. Gregg Henry delivers a good performance as Benson's lover and Chris Lemon provides some occasional charisma. The supporting cast, especially veteran actor Kennedy, also does quite well. A true gem of the slasher genre, that needs no gore to thrill. Definitely well worth seeking out for slasher fans and horror buffs alike. See it!*** 1/2 out of ****",positive,en

Все нам очень нравилось, еда восхитительная, официанты- профессионалы своего дела. Уходили довольные. \nНо в вечер 27 даже не осталось в ресторане. \nДевушка на входе омерзительно выполняла свою работу, стол был забронирован днем. При входе попросили самостоятельно раздеться, при вопросе, а где будет наш стол, чтобы после того, как оставили свои вещи присесть, девушка отвернулась спиной. Охранник заявил одежду повесьте. Мой мч пошел убирать одежду, девушка хостес отправила мыть руки, повторила эту фразу дважды, стоя при этом спиной и полубоком. При повторном вопросе где наш столик, растеряно стояла и не поняла куда нас посадить! Продублировала «сходите руки помойте»! \nК чему вообще- непонятно! Наверное, если я как гость не иду мыть руки, значит не нужно мне трижды об этом напоминать. \nМожно как минимум сказать, подождите, пожалуйста, нам нужно время для подготовки стола.

Ответ отрицательный. \n\nВ итоге покинули заведение с негативом и нежеланием вообще возвращаться! При попытки тихо и спокойно уйти, хостес стала еще и говорить, что мы про просто вам стол готовили.

A FAVOR * pantalla ips. * 32 Gb de disco duro. * 3 Gb de ram. * android 7 EN CONTRA: * muy importante, carencia de chip GPS (ninguna aplicación lo detectaba) a parte de otros muchos sensores. sólo detectaba un acelerómetro. * gráfica muy muy normalita (en juegos 2d, se quedaba pillada a veces) * wifi extremadamente lento... no tiene banda de 5Ghz, y la velocidad de descarga, a pesar que en el enlace indicaba que tenía una calidad de 72 mbps , los juegos grandes tardaban una eternidad en descargarse, o sencillamente no lo hacían. * sonido nefasto. la ubicación de los altavoces en la parte inferior de la tablet hacían que éstos quedaran tapados. además la calidad del sonido era bastante mala. sólo mejoraba al colocarle unos altavoces bluetooth. * y por poner un par de pegas menores... el peso de la misma puede hacer un poco incomodo el trabajo con ella, y que tiende a calentarse demasiado en la parte izquierda de la tablet... desconozco el motivo, pero es así. en resumen. Es una tablet más para un uso infantil, de andar por casa, que para darle un uso más intensivo (como es mi caso) los juegos se desenvuelven de una forma aceptable aunque muchos no de la forma correcta... además ha sido el dispositivo android que más incompatibilidades me ha dado con mi biblioteca de google play, y eso que los he tenido malos de verdad...",neutral,es

"We had one night in Columbus. My husband had business there so I used the opportunity to explore an area I was unfamiliar with and booked one night at this hotel after doing some online research on Columbus. The rate was terrific (under $90). Parking is free and plentiful. The room, although clean, was tired. My only complaint was that the sheets were extraordinarily thin and slipped off the mattress easily. There is no luxury here.
However, the people who work here couldn't have been nicer. (This seems to be true of everyone I met in Ohio.) And the area near the hotel is wonderful. The Best Western Clarmont sits at the edge of the German Village section of Columbus. This neighborhood is a beautiful area to walk around and explore. It reminded me of Beacon Hill (we're from Boston), although flat. It was setlled in the mid-1800's by Germans who built darling, tasteful brick homes along cobblestone streets. The area is beautifully maintained. There are unique shops here and good restaurants. We wandered into Lindey's after passing by a few other choices, had a drink at their magnificent bar, and decided to eat outside in their elegant garden. There was an undeniable buzz at this place, definitely the place to be in COlumbus. At the table next to us was a grande dame who literally seemed to know everyone in town. No one left Lindey's without stopping by her table. (Who was that woman?) The food was good, the experience was wonderful.
After dinner we walked back to our hotel and had one more drink (ok we had a lot to drink that night, but at least we were on foot) at the Round Bar at the Best Western. This a lively bar which attracts a lot of locals - another plus for the BW. Coffee was available in the lobby in the morning, but there is a great breakfast place 3 blocks down the street.",negative,en

"My fiance and I have been going to this gym for almost a year.\n\nIt sometimes can be a little warm in the gym lately, but it doesn't slow me down so it' doesn't bother me really.\n\nThe staff is always top notch! Kai and Jason are always so friendly and nice to us when we check in! Managers Dustin and Brad are the best! Personal trainers Ali and Mike O are the most friendly and caring guys you'll meet. I've had sessions with Mike O since April and have lost around 3% body fat and a load of inches. Although I know I could be much more fit had I watched my eating habits but that's not Mike's fault. Thanks to Mike, I have also seen massive improvement in areas I wanted to help \""accentuate\"" on my body.\n\nAnother plus for me is the gym isn't full of body builders or swimsuit models hogging the mirrors. No creepers, talkers, grunters, and narcissists here! They're mostly nice people as I was a new girl to everything. Some of the guys even offer to help me with things I can't reach or too heavy of weights to change out. And for my fiance, while he was new to using weights, guys were friendly enough to give him some pointers or advice.\n\nIf you're looking for a friendly gym with great managers and staff then this is it! They won't hound you for personal training or brush you off if you have a question about any equipment. Which by the way, the equipment is good. I don't have any complaints there.",positive,en

I am not a fan of pickles so I asked to get it without and it was really yummy. Portions are pretty big/decent size as well. Another plus is that we didn't have to wait very long for our food. \n\nI am rating it 4 stars because the happy hour is from 3-530 on the weekdays. Not the best time frame.

"I reserved the Executive King room, and was not happy with the room I received. There was not a single window in the room, and the closet was a clothes rack by the door.

So I asked to be moved, and was accommodated in a room with two double beds instead, and with two windows (one being in the bathroom). The room was fine, it worked, although the bathroom was quite cramped.
So I got my window, but noise on the street outside was sometimes annoying. The location is great, but you pay the price of there being a lot going on outside your window.

"The atmosphere of the restaurant is very nice. It was clean and had hip vibe about the place. Service was good. I order the roasted turkey avocado sandwich. The sandwich was tasty and had a good bread to meat ratio. I liked the avocado. It was a little heavy on the aioli. My disappointment was in the price for what you received. The sandwich was a good size, but for $9 it should come with some small side (fruit, veggies, chips, cup of soup etc.) It would make the plate look better and for the price of the sandwich I think it is expected. Not sure I will return because of the value. I have eaten a many lunch places and it didn't seem the price met value for what you received.",negative,en

"This place is too crowded - and the line was really long on Saturday night. Luckily I was able to get through without waiting. Tried asking for bottle service, but was told something like the only bottle service left was for $1350 per bottle or something? Ended up just going in... there were some tables that I wouldn't have minded but there were alot where people were just bumping into people all over the place or had like 20 ppl standing around a table designed for 6. I'm not exaggerating either.\nThe music at the main dance floor was pretty decent- good mix of everything. I love that song Shots by LMFAO... so I can't complain about hearing it 3x.\nOverall I guess this place is worth checking out if you plan on getting bottle service and if you want to just say that you've been here.",negative,en

"The energetic young producer of theatrical prologues (those staged performances, usually musical, that often proceeded the movie in the larger cinemas in bygone days) must deal with crooked competition, fraudulent partners, unfaithful lovers & amateur talent to realize his dream of making his mark on the FOOTLIGHT PARADE.While closely resembling other Warner's musical spectaculars, notably the GOLDDIGGER films, this movie had a special attraction none of the others had: Jimmy Cagney. He is a wonder, loose-jointed and lithe, as agile as any tomcat - a creature he actually mimics a few times during the movie. Cagney grabs the viewers attention & never lets go, powering the rapid-fire dialogue and corny plot with his charisma & buoyant charm.The rest of the cast gives their best, as well. Joan Blondell is perfect as the smart-mouthed, big-hearted blonde secretary, infatuated with Cagney (major quibble - why wasn't she given a musical number?). Dick Powell & Ruby Keeler once again play lovers onstage & off; the fact that her singing & acting abilities are a bit on the lean side are compensated for by her dancing ; Powell still exudes boyish enthusiasm in his unaccustomed position as second male lead.Guy Kibbee & Hugh Herbert are lots of fun as brothers-in-law, both scheming to cheat Cagney in different ways. Ruth Donnelly scores as Kibbee's wealthy wife, a woman devoted to her handsome protégés. Frank McHugh's harried choreographer is an apt foil for Cagney's wit. Herman Bing is hilarious in his one tiny scene as a music arranger. Mavens will spot little Billy Barty, Jimmy Conlin & maybe even John Garfield during the musical numbers.Finally, there's Busby Berkeley, choreographer nonpareil. His terpsichorean confections, sprinkled throughout the decade of the 1930's, were a supreme example of the cinematic escapism that Depression audiences wanted to enjoy. The big joke about Berkeley's creations, of course, was that they were meant, as part of the plot, to be stage productions. But no theater could ever hold these products of the master's imagination. They are perfect illustrations of the type of entertainment only made possible by the movie camera.Berkeley's musical offerings generally took one of two different approaches, either a story (often rather bizarre) told with song & dance; or else stunning geometrically designed numbers, eye candy, featuring plentiful chorus girls, overhead camerawork & a romantic tune. In a spasm of outré extravagance, FOOTLIGHT PARADE climaxes with three Berkeley masterworks: `Honeymoon Hotel' and its pre-Production Code telling of a couple's wedding night; `By A Waterfall' - dozens of unclad females, splashing, floating & diving in perfect patterns & designs (peer closely & you'll see how the synchronous effects were achieved); and finally, `Shanghai Lil' - a fitting tribute to the talents of both Cagney & Berkeley.",positive,en

"When deciding on a place to go to dinner for my birthday, I decided to go to one of my usual favorites: Oregano's. This time, instead of going to one of the two Tempe locations, we decided to head out to the Chandler location for a change of scenery.\n\nLike all Oregano's there's a good vibrant atmosphere and the staff is always friendly. The inside was a a little cold for us so we decided to go sit on the patio. The bar tender greeted us and wished us a good meal as we were taken out to the patio and later wished us a good night as we left. The patio at the Chandler location is probably the biggest patio I've seen so far as far as Oregano's goes. Very wide spread with a fire pit in the middle for the winter and two high power mister fans running to keep us cool. Was nice to be able to enjoy the fresh air without being cramped or dying from the heat.\n\nOur waitress AJ was extremely friendly and was very helpful when recommending drinks on the menu. Even though it was the day before her day off, she did a great job of checking in on us, making sure our drinks were filled, and even took the time to chat with us, all the while juggling the other five tables in the same fashion. So major kudos to her for how well she did.\n\nFor starters, the girl and I got drinks. Meagan got the red sangria and I got the D'Liscious Rootbeer Float. I'm not a big wine fan but the Sangria was very good. A nice blend of fruit and wine. Definitely had a kick but was blended very well. The rootbeer float was very good as well. A blend of rootbeer and rum it definitely had that rum taste I like without being overpowering so even Meg enjoyed it, who normally isn't a fan of these kind of drinks.\n\nAlong with the drinks we also got the Oregano's Favorite Salad. I'm glad we agreed to split a Jr. size because if we hadn't we wouldn't have had room for dinner. This salad is huge. The regular size can feed a family of seven. The Jr is big enough for three to four people to share. The Oregano's Favorite is very well named. It has a nice mix of ingredients and toppings, including raisins, giving it a slightly sweet taste. It's one of our favorite standbys when we go to any Oreganos.\n\nFor Dinner, we got another one of our favorites: The Big Rig Pasta. This pasta has got a great kick to it. Just spicy enough to be enjoyable without sacrificing flavor. We always get the Big Rig with the two spicy sausages. For three bucks more, I don't think I could find sausage this tasty and spicy. I recommend slicing them up into bite size pieces and mixing it in with the pasta. Always a great choice.\n\nAnd as if that were not enough, AJ got us a Pizza Cookie for us after Meg let her know it was my birthday. We got the white chocolate macadamia nut cookie since is one of my favorites. In Meg's words, Don't know who's idea it was to make these, but they should be slapped for making everyone fat XD The damn thing is addictive and extremely tasty. And why wouldn't it be? Half baked jumbo cookie with three ice cream scoops on it? What's not to like? Should definitely be split with three or more people if you plan on finishing it (not like that stopped us).\n\nAll and all, it's always a good time coming to Oregano's, no matter the location.",neutral,en

L'ensemble est franchement indigeste en dépit des numéros d'acteurs.

"I flew from Manchester to Las Vegas in so-called ""Premium Economy"". The scheduled plane had a fault so a replacement was provided. During the 11 hour flight we found out that the seats did not recline. We sat bolt upright for 11 hours! As far as I am aware this plane was designed for short haul only. My legs were killing me after only a few hours. On the return flight I chose a bulkhead seat in order to expect good legroom. Big mistake! I am 6ft 2ins and the space between the seat and the bulkhead was ridiculously small. Once again stretching my legs was impossible. 10 hours with my legs tucked underneath is no joke! A complaint to Thomas Cook was sent and they scandalously refused to answer any questions about legality of the seating simply referring me to an independent tribunal panel at a cost of £25! Thomas Cook has ""opted out"" of the CAA complaints review service and they in turn also referred me to the tribunal panel. Disgusting is the only word I have for this airline. Never again will I use them and if you want to I suggest that you read the rest of the scathing reviews. Your choice!",negative,en

When I was asking for a bag to put my laundry (I did not found any on my room) on the bell desk, the guy was surprised that I didn't have a bag. He gave one with some grins and grunts, and when I asked for a pen to fill my laundry list, he told me ""God! you didn't have anything, did you?"" Yes, I was paying for the laundry. Two days after that he same guy gruntled again because I check out ""two many bag pieces"", ""anything else you have hiding someplace?"" he said in a mocking way. For almost 300 dls a day, I will not expect this kind of behavior,

"I love to try new places when traveling and my wife was interested in something \""mild.\""\nFrom their menu on the web it looked like Mahoney's Restaurant had a good selection of American favorites.\n\nThe restaurant was close to our hotel so we walked over and go there about 5:30 pm on a Thursday. It is a bar with larger dinning room, we were seated in a private booth, which was nice because they had a curtain between the booths so it was a nice secluded place to enjoy a meal... I just wish I had enjoyed the meal.\n\nMy wife and I were the only people in the bar/restaurant. We were waited on immediately and our service was good.\n\nWhile the web site is nice, their menu in the restaurant's printed menu was almost impossible to read. I do not know know who picked the font but the number one rule when picking a font is to make it legible. I liked the fact they had descriptions with each menu item but trying to comprehend the message while reading \""through\"" the font was not fun.\n\nMy wife picked the cheese burger and fries. I picked the fish sandwich and sweat potato fries but then changed to plan fries when I learn they put sugar on the sweet potato fries, it was nice of the server to let me know this information.\n\nFood came out quickly. The fries were home-style with skins on and they tasted just like my homemade fries, greasy and soggy. I love fires but I did not finish mine.\n\nMy wifes burger was cooked well done as she liked them and she was afraid it would be dry but it was not she liked it and she liked the crispy toasted bun.\n\nMy fish sandwich was in one word \""yuk.\"" I have never seen fish that thin. It came with a tiny drop of tarter sauce in a plastic container, I asked for more when the sandwich was served and got one more drop of sauce, which might have been enough if the fish had not been so over-cooked that parts of it could not be chewed and swallowed.\n\nI had to keep picking out hard, long stands of fish from my mouth as I tried to eat the fish. There was one long piece of fish and one about 1/2 the length of the other, the perfect amount of fish. The breading was well flavored but the fish was so over-cooked I did not enjoy it. Our serve was nice to refill our drinks but he did not come back to ask if we need anything so I could not ask for more sauce, I used ketchup to try to finish the meal. I know there is a balance of giving dinners privacy and service, so I do not blame the server for not coming back to ask how things were going. He did bring the bill and process the bill quickly at the end of the meal but never did ask, \""how was everything.\"" Good thing he did not ask because I tell the truth when asked.\n\nWhen we left there was only 2 other couples in the place and I think one was related to the owners.\n\nI will not be back and if you have other choices, I think I would recommend trying them before Mahoney's Restaurant.\n\nBecause my wife enjoyed her burger I can not give them one star but if you get a burger skip the fries and go for some other side. Their prices are very affordable.",negative,en

"A group of friends and I, hungry for a late dinner and looking to avoid arguments over what kind of food each person wanted (7 people in total) wandered into Thursdays on a Saturday night. Unfortunately, we had completely forgotten that it was Valentine's Day and the place was packed. \n\nI can not imagine why. \n\nThe host assured us that we would be seated within 10-15 minutes. I guess that was 10-15 minutes Montreal time, but in Boston time it was about 25. Whatever, they were nice enough about it and 25 minutes isn't too bad when there is a bar to sit at and drinks to be had. \n\nAfter 25 minutes, we snaked our way through the restaurant which started to resemble a casting for \""Real Housewives of Orange County\"". After sitting down, I took a look around and realized this was middle-aged, MILF-wannabe heaven. These women looked more fried than the calamari and the men more pruny than the pickles served de gratis at every table.\n\nOrdering was very painless. The waiter was careful to take the ladies' orders first. The service was neither stellar nor poor. We were clearly a number that night, but it would have been nice to have faster service when it came to drinks. The waiter would pass by the table quick enough to get one drink order in, instead of asking us all at once. Oh well. \n\nThe food itself was not very appealing. I ordered the shrimp in garlic butter and was pleased with the quantity of shrimp, but the meal itself was not very tasty. The garlic butter seemed to be just butter and the rice it was served with had no flavor. I don't think it was worth the 20-something dollars I paid for it. \n\nLooking around the table it seemed as if most of my group felt the same. Most plates were unfinished. We passed up the dessert menu and left. \n\nI don't think I would go back, except maybe to hit just the bar as the bartender had an excellent (read: fairly heavy) pour.",negative,en

"I am a little confused by the restaurant and unsure if my review should go here or be listed as a new business. The reason for the confusion is the combination of names that exit. My girlfriend said she recently saw a new restaurant called Don Camaron and wanted to take her mom out for her birthday. She gave me the name and the general location, but I was unable to find it on Yelp or other services. Google turned up similarly named restaurants in other places. Ultimately we found the information on Facebook. As we pulled up we noted the sign stated Don Camaron was \""Now Open\"". We pulled into the parking lot of Urban Heat. As I walked toward the restaurant the sign on the sidewalk read Don Camaron, but the name above the door read Urban Heat. Instead the decor had Urban Heat, but also a logo of the Don Camaron shrimp. The menu read Urban Heat (but had the shrimp logo), the paper ring around the napkin read Urban Heat, and upon check out the receipt reads Urban Heat. Perhaps it is going through a transition and it is both places? The waitress that I had was also very new. She didn't seem to understand me well and she was unfamiliar with the food. \n\nIt appears to be a bar/restaurant, which is how Urban Heat (and the receipt) describe it. The menu included mostly appetizers, tacos, fish, and shrimp. The back page showed multiple types of beer in bottles and draft, but they did not have all of those. One draft they have Bud, Bud Light, Michelob, and \""Amber Bock\"". I asked what Amber Bock and the server did not know. It was either Michelob or Dos X. Either way, it was decent and $2.75 but I received an additional $1.83 discount (maybe happy hour?). There were only maybe 6 other people there besides the 5 of us, so it wasn't a big crowd if it was happy hour.\n\nWe received chips and salsa first (free). My girlfriend's son ordered a hamburger ($8) and I was surprised how quickly it arrived. It was a good size burger served with a side of fries. It was cooked just a little more well-done that I would have liked. My girlfriend's daughter & mom each ordered the Coco Camaron, which is a coconut with shrimp ceviche and shrimp inside. It also had two whole shrimp with heads, eyes, and legs (yuck) mounted on top of the coconut ($16). My girlfriend went with the fish filet ala plancha that was served with a very tasty side of rice and a nice looking salad. This was a nice-sized portion ($9) and I was a little sad that I hadn't ordered it, but I was afraid it would resemble the fried whole fish that was also shown on the menu (yuck again). Instead I went with the nachos (add carne asada), which was supposed to be $6.99 + $2 for the carne, but it appears I was only charge $6.99). My girlfriend also ordered a shrimp cocktail for $12. Throw in a pina colada for $5.50, a $1.83 bottle of water, and a $1.83 bottle of coke - then my girlfriend's daughter decided she would rather have had a hamburger and fries like her brother (another $8) and soon the bill was $95 for the 5 of us.\n\nSome pros - I liked the live Maine lobster claw machine. I don't know if the customer gets to eat the lobster if the claw game picks it up, but it was interesting. The deco was nice, but again with the differences in the name I don't know if that will stay. The fish filet was another highlight of the meal. Otherwise, the hamburgers were a little too well done, my nachos were just okay (and certainly a much smaller portion than the fish filet plate), the server was unsure of the menu, the beer selection was limited, and I wasn't sure what restaurant I was actually visiting. Whatever restaurant it was (Don Camaron or Urban Heat), I don't think it was $95 good. Maybe if there are some big happy hour specials and the name gets worked out it would be worth revisiting, but right now I don't think so.",negative,en

"When I was in school I made a film about a couple roaming around in the trees and talking, and I realized halfway through editing that this was not just a failing aesthetic strategy but a cliché of Canadian cinema: sodden lyricism married to vacant, metaphor-burdened stabs at social commentary. But whatever my own film's failings I feel much better after seeing this...this...thing. For one thing, mine ran 20 minutes, not 85, and had more content at that: every pointless bit of business here is fawned over for four, five, six relentless minutes. The male lead is just incredible, a brow-beating, loudmouthed creep given to outbursts of drama-class improv in between philosophical insights culled from the U of T pub, and he is given lots and lots of space to make us hate him. Admittedly if he weren't such an a**hole then the third act would make even less sense, as a couple snarky dudes show up to provide distant and thoroughly unhelpful echoes of 'exploitation' values; but it doesn't make it any easier to watch the caged creep whimper ""please"" in closeup until the magazine runs out. I take back what I said about AUTUMN BORN, which at least had the courage of its own misbegotten lechery: this cinematic crater is and will remain the very worst Canadian movie of all time. At least, I really really hope so.",negative,en

Total bill for 2 - RM155 for lunch. The funny thing is that I got more gastronomic satisfaction out of our RM5 breakfast of 2 teh tarek (pulled milk tea) and 2 roti canai. I write this to warn fans of good dumplings that this is no Din Tai Fung if you are nostalgic for the real goods because you cannot serve good dumplings without pork and no credible establishment should charge RM3 for a glass of warm water.

"My wife and I stayed here for 2 nights, a thursday and friday. When you arrive you realise you are in a ""scene"" hotel. We arrived about 8pm and the lobby bar/restaurant was packed with the ""beautiful"" people.
Yes, the rooms are small - but so are most hotel rooms in NYC. But the design of the rooms aren't optimal. For starters the bathroom takes up about 40% of the whole room, I like a big bathroom so this is good, but it means you only get closet space for one person, don't bring many clothes to hang up, more than 5 things won't fit. Also there is a whole mini bar closet thingy with what seemed like enough variety of glasses for about 6 guests and a mini bar which is packed and electronically operated - if something is picked up for longer than 30 seconds, you will be charged for it. This means here is no space for any beverage you may want to put in the mini bar yourself - our complimentary bottle of water had to be drunk warm as we couldn't cool it down.
Now to the bathroom. What a shocking presentation. The toilet looks and feels like something you would find in jail. The wash basin is totally impractical, you have to bend at an unnatural angle when brushing your teeth. But the best bit is the wooden stick thingy where you are supposed to hang your towels. It literally is a couple of pieces of wood joined together which you could carry out if you wished, you have to lean it against a wall. Seriously, for a hotel of this star rating the bathroom is simply bad.
Despite all this I would stay here again for one simle reason The View! At the end of the day that is what you are paying for. An unobstructured view of Midtown Manhatten. From our bed we could look over at the Empire State Building! Awesome. Then yes from 5 to 9 you can go up to the trendy nightclub before the ""beautiful"" people invade and have a fantastic view of the city. Yep you have to be dressed appropriately but hey when you are up there <ou feel like a million dollars.
Additionally the staff were all really wonderful. Super friendly and as someone who doesn't look like the trendy crowd they are going for here, I never once felt anything other than fully welcome.

"There is not enough time or space to give all the reasons to avoid this place at all cost. Believe the other reviews because they are correct. For me, it is the second time in a row (the other was several years ago in El Paso, TX) that a Motel 6 turned out to be the opposite of the company's advertising. This San Diego version is VERY old and worn out, with no flat-screen TV, no plugs for the sink and bathtub, WRITING ON ONE OF THE SHEETS, no clock/radio, not a good location, etc., etc., etc. When we entered the room and opened the drapes, we discovered that the window to an alleyway was open and the screen pushed out! Good thing we made that discovery. The place is undergoing a renovation (apparently our room hasn't been done yet), but my suggestion is to bulldoze the place and start over! --Don't know what they would do about the noise factor. The place owes me a refund. If we hadn't arrived so late and so tired, we would have gone elsewhere--almost anywhere else. Do we blame Accor for the deterioriation of the Motel 6 brand?",negative,en

"My husband and I stayed at this hotel since we did not want to stay in downtown Ft. Worth for an event at the convention center. We got an excellent price for the hotel on their website. The hotel is very easy to get to off of the highway.
This hotel appears to be very new and is in excellent condition. Our king size bed was very comfortable and there is a large flat screen TV in the room. The bathroom was large and had a very large bathtub. We had a pull-out sofa as well as a fridge and microwave.
My two main problems with the hotel were the noise and the temperature of the water in the shower. The walls seem to be pretty thin....our first night we could hear almost everything going on in the room next to ours. I am a light sleeper so I did have trouble sleeping. When we went to take a shower in the morning, the water was luke warm at best. I think the hotel might be trying to save money with keeping the temperature low. We had the shower on full blast hot and it still felt barely warm. After about 20 minutes the water will start to get hot, but I think that defeats the purpose!
There are no restaurants near the hotel although down the street there is a putt-putt and arcade facility. It is also about 10 minutes from the mall. (There is a shopping center across the street from the mall that had an excellent Asian restaurant!)
I don’t think I would stay at this hotel again despite the value. I thought they had an excellent breakfast bar but I really need to be able to sleep when I go out of town. If you are a heavy sleeper, then this hotel will be great for you! :)",negative,en

"Ok as a backpack, not that great as a leash
My wife thought this was the cutest little thing she’d seen. She wanted it mainly for the harness and leash. Unfortunately because of the way the straps are designed it doesn’t work all that well for that part. The chest buckle is way too low which I didn’t notice when I was ordering it. If you were to actually try to use this on a child as a harness it’s not very secure and slips way up if they’re tugging on it at all. It would have been much better if the chest strap had been adjustable up and down. One idea I had was adding a strap all the way across that attaches to the pack instead of the shoulder pads and comes across under his armpits. But that’s a lot of work to make it useable. It’s possible maybe he’ll grow into it a little better eventually but that doesn’t really help me now. It really is cute on him though so if you don’t care about the harness it might be worth getting. One other negative is the adjustable part on the shoulder pads isn’t hemmed, so when you loosen it, it can come all the way out and you have to rethread it. It’s a pretty easy fix to just fold over the fabric and sew it, but it’s something that should have already been done.",negative,en

"No complaints about the hotel. Spacious, modern and clean rooms. Good breakfast. Excellent staff at breakfast especially the guy who cheered everyone up. My only reservation is the location if you don't have a car. There is nothing really to do within walking distance. The hotel is in a residential area and borders a main road. You can walk to mission bay park, but there are no facilities there. Taxis are very expensive-$20 for les than 3 miles. We ended up renting bikes from mission beach and when necessary took the bus and then the tram. You can get a daily travel card for $5. There really are no options for eating or drinking nearby and the so called beach is just a narrow strip of sand and not worth visiting",neutral,en

"I have to agree with most, if not all of the negative reviews. In contradiction to a previous hotel response, the hallway doors have NOT been fixed. They still remain ajar, they do not self-close/securely lock. What good is a door if it doesn't do its job? This is a serious safety issue for all guests. The halls and rooms are dimly lit and the paint is old/chipped. The wallpaper is peeling and the bathroom tiles don't match. The shower rod was not securely fastened to the wall and the curtain itself was missing hooks. The rooms are musty and I saw water damage on the ceiling - it was bubbled. Because of the smell and the water damage, I was worried about mold. I don't know if that is in fact the case, but it still made me uneasy so I called for a bottle of Febreze to keep in my room. The fact that this place seemed unclean, I felt like I should buy a UV black light and brought Lysol wipes. I made sure not to walk barefoot on the carpet and was leary to lay on the comforter. Housekeeping is only allowed to give one bottle of shampoo, etc. (which doesn't smell so good), unless otherwise specifically requested by a guest for more.

"My wife and I set out for a night out in the big city. We usually stay at the Vintage Park (another Kimpton Hotel) however we had received an email inviting us to The Alexis. Upon arriving at the hotel we were greeted by a very friendly front desk. They recognized that it was our first time staying at the Alexis. Upon hearing that we usually stay at the Vintage Park, they teasingly responded with ""Oh we are definitely going to steal you away."" To which, we were immediately upgraded to the ""Northwest Ballet Suite""; I'd say that's a good start.
This room was amazing!! Upon opening the door, you are greeted with this long entry way; far away from the hall. The entry way, as well as the entire room is adorned with beautiful pictures of the Northwest Ballet's incredible dancers. There was a separate bedroom with a huge picture window enveloped by an arched window frame with a rope light nestled inside, casting just the right amount of ambience down onto the sheer curtains and creating the perfect romantic atmosphere.
There was another hallway connecting the entry way to the dining and living area surrounded by a wall of windows. The room was on the corner of the building and there was an awesome view of Elliot Bay from anywhere in the room. This room was bigger than some studio apartments. We were really impressed.
We had dinner at the Elephant & Castle on 5th Avenue. They have the best Grilled Salmon with this cider glaze baked on. We pretty much eat there everytime we come to the city. Later that night we came back to the hotel and had drinks at the Library Bistro. I have to say that The Alexis is in a great location for shopping and dining. The next day we walked up to Westlake Center and did some shopping. It was a wonderful weekend and we would love to do it again sometime soon. Who knows; maybe we'll be seeing The Alexis again sooner than we thought......sorry Vintage Park.",positive,en

"This is the official sequel to the '92 sci-fi action thriller. In the original, Van Damme was among several dead Vietnam War vets revived to be the perfect soldiers (Unisols). In this one, it's, I guess, about a dozen years later, since Van Damme has a daughter about that age. Now he's working with the government in a classified installation to train the latest Unisols - codenamed Unisol 2500, for some reason. As usual, something goes wrong: the on-site super-computer (named Seth - like the snake in ""King Cobra"" the same year) goes power-crazy, takes command of the Unisols, and even downloads its computer brain into a new super-Unisol body (Jai White). We're lookin' at the next step in evolution, folks! Most of Van Damme's fights are with one particularly mean Unisol (pro wrestler Goldberg) who just keeps on comin': drop him off a building - no good; run him down with a truck - no go! Shoot him, burn him - forgetaboutit! Much of the humor is traced to how Van Damme is now outmoded and out-classed(he's even going grey around the edges). But, though he takes a lickin', he keeps on kickin'! Most sequels of this sort are pretty lame - pale imitations of the originals, and while this one is certainly no stroke of genius, it manages to be consistently entertaining, especially if you're a pro-wrestling fan.",negative,en

I should've been more concerned when everything was so laid back, but that's me so I wasn't stressing.\nFor starters the package we purchased came with a one night stay that the chapel is supposed to book... Which they did not! They're reasoning was that we didn't tell them we were staying any other nights at the hotel. I'm not sure what difference that made but they fixed the error. \nThe ceremony itself was fun and the officiant really made it feel like it wasn't the same thing he had just done 30 minutes ago which I really liked. \nAs for the video.photography it was rotten! Our contract says no recording and no flash photography during the ceremony... the photographer announced NO PHOTOS period!!! NONE!!! After the ceremony the photographer was doing all the typical wedding photos that are wanted. Unfortunately she was relying on me to tell her what to do and when I finally said \""Ok, I just got married, never been married before this is your job why don't you tell me what pictures I should be doing?' Her response was \""Ok we're done here\"" With full on attitude... Umm I'm sorry but weren't we paying you to handle that part?\nSo we go the next day to check out the photos and was ready to have to drop some serious money as we assumed they wouldn't be cheap. We walked in to a desk with 2 8x10's, this cheesy collage thing and some other random stuff. We had 24 images that came with our package so we decided to go thru the 120 or so pics the photographer got. (Which was actually quite a bit for a 30 min ceremony) We seperated them in have to have & maybe & No.... WE HAD 12 HAD TO HAVE PICTURES!!!! That was it! 10 Maybe!!! The edited ones were elemntary photoshop... thr ironic part was that in one of the black white images my flowers were the only thing in color.... my flowers should have been lavender.... THEY WERE PINK! I didn't catch it until then!! My best man should've had a lavender boutenierre and it was white! Long story short we left with strictly the 24 that came with our package and I had to call her again to get the photo album that was supposed to come with it as well..... which was recieved with yet another attitude! At the end of the day I'm married to my best friend and the service itse lf was great.... But I definitely wouldn't recommend them!\nP.S. saw the video when we got home.... not worth what we paid for it either!",negative,en

"Me and my husband stayed at the Bedford hotel this past week. We spent a night there. It was fairly cheap (for the city). The size of the room was great - we had a king size bed, the personnel was friendly, the location amazing!!! Only couple of blocks to times square. What was a little disappointing was how the room wasn't very clean - it could use a little vacuum and the bath tub wasn't washed either...

"Jack Brooks' quirks are, at first, somewhat charming and lend to the deliberately campy feel of the beginning of this movie.I found myself getting angrier and angrier as I was duped into seeing this one through to the end, in hopes that the payoff would be worth the super-tedious wait.The climax can't begin to make up for all the setup time.Normally one might expect shallow characters from this genre. But the fact that the wait-time-before-action index is so high, should mean that the meantime would be devoted to some interesting character development.Not so.While not without its initial charms, this movie ultimately infuriates, and disappoints.Wish I could get all that setup time back, to reinvest it into something that pays off.",negative,en

"This is the best direct-to-DVD effort from Van Damme that I have seen yet. Van Damme plays a border patrol agent who is out to stop heroin smugglers trying to cross into the United States. The action in this movie is great and the fight scenes rank with Van Damme's best. Costar Scott Adkins shows why he should be the next big star in the martial arts genre. For further evidence check out ""Undisputed 2"". Adkins is so good in fact that before I watched ""The Shepherd"", I thought that Van Damme might not look very believable in defeating him on screen. Van Damme holds his own though and although he isn't quite as athletic as Adkins is, he can still kick with the best of them. All of the fight scenes in this film are very well done and the gun battles are above average for this type of film as well. The only negative thing I can say about this movie is that the story is a little underdeveloped. I think Van Damme's character's motives should have been presented earlier in the movie, especially in regard to why he carries around a rabbit. The reason he does is very cool but you don't find out until the very end. There are a couple of other things that are never really explained either but this is a Van Damme movie so you know where the priority lies in making this kind of movie and it ain't character development. Overall though, this is a solid action movie that I recommend. So run for the Damme border!",positive,en

"Dining in La Sal @ Casa Del Mar was one of the highlights of our family trip during our stay in July . We decided to dine there after much contemplation but it turned out to be one of the best decisions we made. We didn't have a reservation and had to wait a while to be seated but the staff were friendly and it was worth the wait as we were given a table on the beach. The ambience was excellent and the weather very much in our favor. The F&B Manager, Robert Khor was extremely helpful and very friendly. It was the good service provided by him and his staff as well as the quality of the food that made it a memorable dining experience.The mains are priced on average at RM 65 and we had a pitcher of Sangria priced at RM 75 which was reasonable. The Lamb and Australian Beef were recommended. All of our dishes were seasoned to perfection and delicious. It is advisable though to make a prior reservation as it is quite busy on most days. All in all, a wonderful and memorable dining experience. Highly recommended for those who expect quality from your food and excellent service during your dining experience.",positive,en

"Traveling my wife for an anniversary we found the Monaco Baltimore and its aquarium deal for a weekend in mid July. Close to the inner harbor and with great boutique feel, this hotel is a reconstructed building with a grand feel. The fireplace in the lobby, the friendly staff, the marble foyer, and unique room architecture and design sets this place apart from ""normal"" hotels. The restaurant on the ground floor has high ceilings and interesting textures and i couldn't help staring with a smile at the pig-shaped pottery over by the wood burning stove.
Our aquarium package included a continental breakfast, which here basically means choose a bread, a cereal and juice. Great care was shown even when my croussaint, granola with yogurt and berries, and cranberry juice arrived. So while, it may sound meager it was plenty for a day of walking in the the inner harbor.
The consierge was extremely knowledgeable and your only blocks away from Camden yards or the football stadium. There was a valet fee, yet the service only added to my peace of mind as when i arrived i just got out the car with my bags to the front door. When I left, I walked out the front door into my car and began the trip home.
All in all, very lovely place to stay for a romantic weekend when you want to class it up a little.",positive,en
"I really didn't expect to like this story so much since it is for a younger reader than myself. I wanted to read it due to the title, Off The Grid. It seemed like a strange situation for these kids to get into. Living off the grid myself, I thought the book would be more about living that way, than a bunch of underage kids on an adventure. Well, what can I say? The story got me caught up in it and I kept reading. It was a fun read and I enjoyed it very much.This is a story of a family who had recently lost their father and had to move from their home to their grandfather's ranch that their mother had inherited. They sold everything and packed up the car and headed to Promise, Oregon with just enough money to get there. Along the way things happen and they get separated from their mother and are on their own. With the fear of being picked up by the police and put in a foster home without any parents, they manage to get to Oregon on their own.The characters were believable, and once they got to their grandfather's farm, the story really took off for me. I liked the sense of humor the girl telling the story has and the fact that she played a guitar and had an addiction to candy. I loved the part where their grandfather's preps kept them fed and able to survive on their own. While they discovered things about a grandfather they did not know, they also discovered responsibility, and caring for each other.",positive,en

"Prima di partire non abbiamo trovato recensioni su questo hotel, dato che è nuovissimo, e temevamo brutte sorprese... per fortuna tutto è andato bene!
l'hotel è pulito ed a soli 2 blocks dalla fermata East Broadway del subway, linea F, che con circa 15 min ti porta a Time Square.
La stanza non era enorme, ma andava comunque bene, il bagno sempre pulito con cambio biancheria ogni giorno.
Avevevamo la stanza sul lato della ferrovia (praticamente il treno ci passava in camera!) ma con i doppi vetri abbiamo dormito tranquillamente (abbiamo il sonno pesante però; chi ha il sonno leggero farebbe meglio a chiedere una stanza dall'altro lato.)
La zona è Chinatown, quindi la cosa meno simpatica è stato l'odore di cibo cinese ad ogni ora del giono e della notte appena messo piede fuori dall'hotel.
Grande disponibilità da parte dello staff, sempre cordiale; abbiamo potuto lasciare senza problemi le valigie dopo il checkout, e quando abbiamo chiesto allo staff di chiamarci un taxi è arrivata una lincoln nera con autista che ci ha portato al JFK per 45 $ (la tariffa flat che fanno anche i taxi gialli).

"If this was a short story to draw the reader into the series - it FAILED big time.Nissa goes to a Vampire club because she wants sex with a vampire and to ultimately become a Vampire herself - (maybe because she is lonely, not really explained). The author tells you that Nissa is drawn to the club and to Hex & Aleron. The reader is then told after days of having sex in every way possible in a menage that love now exists. At that point - all I could do was think - well, that's nice - didn't ever feel the love but whatever.I like stories with a high ""heat"" factor but I also want well-developed plots with interesting characters and interactions.In this novella:- Dialogue was flat- Characters one dimensional- No originality- The plot is ????? - not sure if there is one- Sex scenes read more like a ""how to"" book than an erotic scene- Rushed HEA - they had sex and then the reader is told that they are in love - didn't really feel itThe short story was mostly pages after pages of the three having sex but I would describe it as just graphic rather than erotic and definitely not sizzling. If you want a very short ""how to"" book on a few of the different ways to have sex - then this book is for you. Not very imaginative but it does contain some of the standard ways found in countless of erotica books that are more original and better developed.",negative,en

"We're entering the W hotel in Seattle on the Seneca Street Side (important to do because the check-in desk is on the second level!). We're greeted by a young professional staff who are genuiney attentive and fully aware that even though their hotel is a meeting place for the upwardly mobile youngsters that make Seattle great, a lot of their customers are a genertion older. And they respect that. Kudos. The lobby, lounge and bar/restaurant are colorful, an explosion of post-modernism...and quite simply what all of Seattle is about. We booked a Cool Corner Room, which turned out to be so clean, so spacious, and comfortably sleek and modern with the decor knob turned down just enough to welcome you, leave you feeling...young and ready to take on one of America's best cities. Naturally, there's a Stabucks across the street (yay!) and you're within a short walk to Pikes Place Market; a quick taxi gets you to the Space Needle. W is a great place to land on your feet. Priced a little higher than most - but well worth it. Please note that 4th Street is a major thru way, so there is traffic. But isn't that what makes a stay at a downtown hotel sort of ...charming?",positive,en

"A friend took me to dinner for my birthday at this location this week.\n\nThe food was great. I rarely eat ribs, but think they have some of the best here. The meat falls of the bone. The sauce is just about right, tangy but not to strong. A plus to the bartender as well, he knows how to mix a good ginger ale.\n\nI want to recommend Rachel,our server, to anyone who goes to this location. Here is a young woman who really knows how to do her job. The service she provides is acceptable in every way so I can't complain. She also did something very special that proves she really listens to her customers when she does her job.\n\nMy friend I went to dinner with is 91 with Alzheimer's. With this illness, this could be our last time she gets to celebrate my birthday with me so it really was important to me that things went well. She let Rachael know that for my birthday she wanted a cake served with a candle. I tried to explain to my friend, Norma, that they didn't do that at this restaurant which I know disappointed her but what could I say. After finishing a full rack of ribs, I could use the excuse that I was to full to have a desert so could get around the cake and candle situation. At this point Rachael asked me if I was ready for my birthday desert and expressed that she thought I'd really enjoy it and she gave Norma a big smile so I said fine. I couldn't believe it when she came out with a scoop of ice cream with a candle in it. This delighted Norma and touched my heart as Norma sang Happy Birthday\"" to me. This is service ask for Rachael! She get's five stars!\n\nThere is only one thing I could suggest that would improve my experience at Outback. I think the bring out the entree a bit sooner than I would like after the salad is served. A little more time in between would be nice.",neutral,en

Viene muy bien presentado. Una caja con tres protectores envueltos cada uno en una funda protectora, con tres sobres de toallita con alcohol en buen estado y una gamuza por cada protector. La colocación es muy fácil, no he tenido ningún problema. La cuestión es que el protector cubre bien la pantalla respecto a la altura, pero de ancho... Pues queda medio centímetro por cada lado sin cubrir. Es lo que menos me gusta, aunque no cubriera todo el ancho por ser de cristal curvo creo que podría ser un poco más ancho. Por lo demás es resistente. Se cayó el móvil y el protector se rajó un poco pero la pantalla resistió. Queda bien pegado, no se despega como en otros móviles que he tenido en las que el protector se cayó al suelo al día siguiente de ponerlo.

"I have stayed here before and decided to stay around the holidays. I got a great deal being a SPG member (their hotel rewards program). I can't complain much about my stay based on the price but here is some info for others.
The hotel is in a great location for shoppers, tourists and nearby conventions. The rooms are small but the beds are nice, clean and comfortable. Water in the bathroom was loud but the bathroom was clean. The work area was small and would be cumbersome for those on business.
Do not get a room on the same level as the pool, the hallway smelled like chlorine. The only advantage to a lower floor was that I did not have to wait for an elevator- it was slow and crowded.
The lobby was crowded and confusing to get to from the mall level. Staff seemed nice though I had little interaction with them.
This is not a bad hotel, I would recommend staying there if you can get a price is right. For the same price you may be able to stay at the nearby, nicer Marriott or Westin.",negative,en

"Отделение банка, где работают самые не компетентные сотрудники. С таким никогда не сталкивалась в других банках. Первый случай моего возмущения был, когда обратилась за кредитом в этот банк несколько лет назад. Обслуживала меня, сотрудница, одновременно обсуждала с рядом сидящей коллегой, что ей купить поесть на обед. Т.е.мое присутствие, видимо, мешало уйти на обед. В итоге она забыла сделать копию пасторта и прикрепить к делу. Как такое возможно???? Просто немыслимо в серьёзном учреждении. На следующий день звонила и просила прийти с паспортом, а то она забыла прикрепить копию, обсуждая свой обед, одновременно заполняя заявку на мой кредит. Кошмар! Второй случай в этом же отделении был два дня назад. Обратилась в отделение по закрытию кредитной карты, было несколько вопросов, сотрудница ответила на мои вопросы, но когда я в приложении закрыла свою карту, выяснилось, что условия совсем другие, нежели мне был дан ответ. Жуткая некомпетентность сотрудников! Просто безобразие! Сама система обслуживания работает безобразно в банке. В приложении высвечивается одна дата и сумма платежа, в сообщении приходит другая сумма, всегда платила большую из этих двух. Но однажды мне звонят и говорят, а Вы вчера не оплатили кредит. На моё возмущение, как так, в приложении стоит дата платежа только завтра, мне сказали, нет, мол, вчера надо было оплатить. После моего невероятного возмущения, мне вовсе перестали приходить оповещения и в приложении выставлять сумму и дату оплаты 2 месяца. После чего снова стали приходить сообщения, но они уже стали совпадать с информацией в приложении. В общем, полная некомпетентность сотрудников, безобразная система работы банка.

I saw Ka last night at the 9:30 pm show and I was amazed! The seats we got were row gg seats 21 and 22 for about $250. These are not the most expensive seats available so I was worried about not being able to see well. I was pleasantly surprised when I realized they were actually pretty decent! I had no trouble seeing the stage and did not miss any of the action. So save yourself some money and opt for the cheaper tickets! \n\nThis was my first Cirque show and I really enjoyed it. It was full of action and had some cute comedy parts. The only thing I have to complain about is the storyline is a little hard to follow deeper into the show. The ending also felt a tad rushed but the finale kinda made up for it! The visuals and moving platforms are absolutely amazing!\n\nDefinitely don't regret picking Ka as my first Cirque show.

"Ok so as I wrote in another recent review, I frequent Vegas too much for my own good. I can't even count the times i've been there since i've turned 21 six years ago! Anyways, I've heard a lot of mixed reviews about Tryst but finally decided to give it a try during my visit back in June. \n\nWe were a mixed group of 4 girls and 3 dudes and arrived at the Wynn around 11pm. There was a pretty long line outside the club but we decided to just stick it out and wait. The line moved at a decent pace for a good 30 minutes but as soon as we got to the front area of the line, it just stopped. We didn't move at ALL for a good hour! I finally flagged down one of the club hosts and asked him how much to get myself and my group in right now. He said $25 each for the guys, girls can just go ahead in. So the guys paid up and we finally headed toward the 'box office' at the entrance. Once there, us girls were still free (we picked up passes earlier that day) but the guys had to pay an additional $30 to get IN in! Poor guys but it's a given that they have to pay an arm and a leg extra than what girls have to pay in vegas. \n\nOk so for the club itself... the layout is pretty cool. Half of it is indoors and the other half out. The waterfall is majestic and gorgeous, and you almost can't believe that you're inside a dance club. There are two huge bars at each end of the club, and cocktail waitresses carrying shots of patron for the lazy (or smart!) who don't feel like waiting at the bar. Ofcourse you have to purchase a bottle to sit at the tables here, which I HIGHLY recommend especially if you're with a mixed group. It'll get you in easier. I was there on a Friday night and the dance floor was PACKED. We could hardly move, yet it was ok since I wasn't really feeling the music. That night they played more techno than anything else. I remember the crowd being pretty mixed...so that's always a good thing. The bathroom is kinda neat but can be trippy since it's circular with mirrors all around. If you're drunk, please bring a friend to help you navigate your way to and from the toilet and the sink! I saw a lot of mishaps while waiting for my turn!\n\nWould i go back to Tryst again?? Meh, probably if i go with a group that gets bottle service. We'll see!",negative,en

"My best friend and I had a 5K race in downtown Columbus and she booked two rooms each with 2 double beds. When we got there in the evening there was no one at the desk, the girl who was working was sitting on the other side of a wall, and we stood there for about 5 minutes before she came back. Check in went smoothly, but when we got up to our room, it was a suite with a king bed. We called down to the desk and told the girl the situation and she told us that there was nothing she could do because the whole hotel was booked. When we told her that our booking was confirmed for two double beds she then told us that since we booked through a 3 party website (i.e. Priceline) that our reservations weren't guaranteed. So we called Priceline and explained the situation to them. While my friend was on the phone with them I turned down our bed to check the sheets (I'm a clean freak especially when it comes to hotels) and there was a long hair in the middle or the bed. I immediately called down to the desk and told the girl about it, and she told me that housekeeping is gone at night and there was no one to come up and change the sheets. And she couldn't do it because she was the only one there and she can't leave the desk unattended. She then told me she could bring me new sheets up to my room. She could leave the desk to bring me new sheets but I had to change the sheets myself. In the meantime, the customer service representative from Priceline.com put my friend on hold to call the hotel himself, and a gentleman answered the phone. But the girl told me she was the only one there!!! The gentleman then told the representative that he didn't know why we were complaining because they upgraded us to a King suite. We never asked to be upgraded! If we had been a couple it would have been fine, but we're not. So needless to say there was nothing anyone could do because they were booked for the night. After that fiasco, i started my task of remaking the bed, and when I went to put the fitted sheet on the bed it only covered half the bed. She had brought me the wrong size sheet! I then walked down to the front desk and waited another 5 minutes because both the girl and the gentleman were behind the wall talking and laughing. When they finally noticed me, the gentleman came out and I asked him for the right size sheet, he asked the girl if she had given me king size sheets and she replied, ""I gave her sheets."" Her name is Claire and she was very rude and very short with us from the start. I will never stay here again and would recommend any other hotel in that area instead.",negative,en

"I spent the weekend with girlfriends at this destination spa over the weekend. This place was a wonderful getaway that I look forward to visiting again one day soon. The place was not very hard to find and is set off in a secluded area well protected from outside intrusions. Upon arrival check in was quick and well organized. We were oriented with all the activities, dining options and everything else we may have needed while there. The staff is superb. They treated us like royalty and did their very best to meet any request we may have had. The activities are varied and taught by individuals who care about their craft. We took yoga, meditation, breathwork and cooking classes. We also did the challenge course which was totally exhilarating!!! If you are not afraid of heights you should definitely give it a go. We stayed on resort for all our meals since it was included in the total Travaasa package. The food is wonderful and you are told that almost everything they cook with is locally grown. Ben is the chef we took a class with and aside from being drop dead handsome...his dinners were a wonderful way to end the night. Also, they have a variety of options for all types. I am vegetarian and had plenty of options to choose from for each meal while my girlfriends claimed to have eaten some of the best steak and chicken they ever had. We each had our own rooms and they had everything a person would need. Flat screen tvs, plush queen size beds, privacy options, hygiene products, plenty of towels, ac/heat operation, great in room coffee (which is hard to find these days), daily newspapers, feminine products, etc. The rooms were very clean and housekeeping checked in daily. Finally, the spa. I chose two treatments for the weekend to include the ancient purification massage and the chakra healing energy treatment. These were great and I would definitely recommend them to others. There are so many to choose from and you can't go wrong...as it is what they do. There is a beautful pool, dry sauna, jacuzzi and full service locker room. Every staff person I met seemed truly pleased to work there and their actions toward guests reflected that.

"Was in NYC for the weekend. Needed a hotel for Friday night only - and since it's the Holiday season...almost every hotel in town 3* + is $300-400 on Fri and Sat nights. So finding Astor on the Park for $210ish...was a great deal.
Quick facts:
Not within walking distance to Times Square (40 blocks away)
Right across from Central Park (very convenient)
Building is old (but isn't most of NYC?)
Staff at front desk were polite and smiling
Door locks/Beds/TV/carpet/AC unit are all out of date but functional
Bathroom was actually quite nice (nicer than bedroom)

"I love Italian food, I also love Japanese food. However I have my reservations for ""fusion"" food such what this restaurant has to offer. You see, a lot of fusion restaurants tend to incorporate more than one kind of cooking into their dishes without first mastering the basics of one particular cooking style. This tends to make the taste of their food out of balance and balance is what separate the good from the bad, or in this case, the good from the great.Lets get one thing straight off the bat, some of the dishes (at least the ones that I have tasted so far) in this place is above average compared to other places in Ipoh, and IT SERVES PORK which to me says ""the chef has some balls! and integrity"" because it is very very difficult to survive (in the F&B industry) in Ipoh if you are not giving 2 hoots to our Malay friends. Many many entrepreneurs who opened restaurants that serves pork in this place closed shop because they were unable to serve the 30% Malay population (at least) thus loosing potentially 1/3 of business revenue. And I love pork. For me, if you are not serving pork in a so called ""Japanese"" or ""Italian"" restaurant you DON'T DESERVE to be called that because pork is the soul of the food of these 2 great nations.Now comes the specific (personal) analysis of the dishes that my group ordered. Firstly the appetizers, the Caesar salad with bruschettas and mushroom soup. The dressing of the salad is spot on, very nice and not overly dressed. To me it is the perfect salad. But it comes with 2 bruschettas and one of them is the ota-ota flavoured. Seriously...ota-ota? If you want to do something different just for the sake of doing something different, DON'T. It RUINED the whole salad dish. What did I say about balance of flavours (this sentence will repeat very often in this review)? First you serve me a fresh, well dressed and very refreshing salad and then you expect to tingle my senses by that ota-ota? Don't get me wrong, I don't dislike ota-ota, I like it on it's own, but not with a perfect Caesar salad. On the other hand, the mushroom soup just tasted like any regular mushroom soup that's was in a package from a Tesco.Then I had my ""Classic Carbonara"" which is quite confusing because there is NOTHING CLASSIC about this dish. When it arrived I found some bonito flakes on top albeit a very tiny amount shaved very thinly, you would hardly notice them if you do not cook any Japanese dishes. I do, so they are very obvious to me. Ok then, it's NOT Classic in any way, they should name it ""Fusion Carbonara"" instead. This is just nitpicking in the name and I apologize to waste your time. The question is: WHY? Is it to enhance the flavour of the dish? You can't, not with this tiny amount. Is it to enhance the presentation? You also can't, not with this tiny amount shaved this thin you can hardly notice them. So what's the point? Please be reminded that this is a pasta dish that consist of at least 30% cheese in it, so any subtle ingredients in small amount will just be wasted. The fundamental basics of how to make a good carbonara is the balanced mix of good cheese, good eggs and parsley to accentuate the richness of these 3 core ingredients. The cheese is there for the richness. The eggs are there to combine all the elements, to soften the taste of the cheese a bit and also to make the sauce smoother and runnier. The parsley (which a lot of people ignore and is more important than you think) is there to provide balance of flavours between the 3 core ingredients, to lessen the blow of the cheese - egg mixture and to provide colouring to the whole dish. I am disappointing to say that the parsley was not there in this dish. This caused it to look bland, and too rich because they put too much cheese in the mixture and the balance is totally out.There's the 'Pasta with Bacon and Cherry Tomatoes' that my wife ordered. Most of the time this combination of bacon and cherry tomatoes is perfect. You have flavourful smoky bacon and you have slightly stir fried sweet sweet cherry tomatoes, how can you top that? By adding in long beans? NO! Usually long beans are great if they are the main ingredient but in this case, they are just SOME ingredient they chef put in there to be different. If this pasta is called 'Pasta with Long Beans (with bacon & tomatoes)' with long beans as the core of the dish then it will be great. It's also the way they cooked the long beans. They have been very slightly stir fried to make them look fresh and light green. Good if it's on it's own, bad if mixed with other subtle ingredients. This is a grave error in this particular dish because the their smell covers the entire dish. We had a pasta that only taste like under-cooked long beans with a slight hint of bacon and tomatoes. It's like the rookie's error of under cooking bell peppers for a pasta dish, the whole thing will just taste like raw vege.I almost forgot to mention the pasta itself. If you know how to make fresh pasta yourself it wouldn't be anything special but if you don't (not interested, lazy etc.) then it is something worthwhile to try it out in this place.We also ordered the Sakura Pork which tasted quite amazing. It very juicy and tender with good flavour and reminds me of freshly roasted Chinese pork with a pineapple sauce. Speaking of pineapple sauce, this sauce is the highlight of the day. The balance is spot on, the flavour is incredible and it compliments the pork perfectly.Then comes the dessert. I am not THAT into sweet stuff, but some of the options here are quite good. The Chocolate Mousse is GREAT, it's got a hint of bitterness to it which I love and it actually tasted like Belgium Chocolate and the Creme Brulee was not bad (which is high praises from me). But the Semifreddo is not my cup of tea. The Tiramisu is quite acceptable except for the taste of alcohol was too strong, balance of taste is not up to par here but I applaud the chef for using alcohol, at least it's made the correct way and it's really home made. There are just too many shops in this country selling disgusting feces and they dare to name them Tiramisu without a hint of alcohol in them and then charge a fortune to rip people off. This place is NOT one of them.I also want to mention the environment. There's no denying it, it's quite nice and cozy because the place is so small. The decorations are kept at a minimal but everything is clean and very inviting. The only issue we had is the weather of Malaysia and El Nino. On that evening we are experiencing super high heat, and the 3 tiny 1-2hp air-con units in the dining room were unable to keep up with. They should have installed 2 units of 5hp air-con but due to (presumably) their inexperience in running their own business they opt to save cost in buying 3 units of small air-con. I pity them because in the long run, their electricity bills will stack up like mad, since small air-cons uses so much more juice when they are running at full capacity compared to big ones running at low in the same environment.The conclusion is this restaurant can do better and has huge potential if the chef can adjust his style a bit and improve on his basics. I just hope TNB bills will not make them close shop.",neutral,en

في هذه المسرحية المؤلمة يعري سعد الله نوس بلا رحمة الساسة الذين لا هم لهم إلا الدفاع عن عروشهم، بكل ما للعرش من معنى ضيق. الدفاع عن الكراسي الخشبية لا عن شرف الأمة والعباد. يعري رجال الدين وتجارتهم بالدين في سبيل النجاة بأنفسهم وأرواحهم. يعري من يمكنون للغزاة من أهل العلم، ولو صح ما صوره عن موقف ابن خلدون لكانت طامة كبرى في رأي ما فعله سعد الله ونوس في هذه المسرحية قاس قسوة لها ما يبرر لها، فهو لا يتكلم عن التاريخ بقدر ما يتكلم عن الحاضر، فنحن نعيش في عصر الاضمحلال تماما كما كان يعيش العرب والمسلمون في أيام حملات التتار وغزوهم للبلاد العربية المسرحية لا تتكلم عن التاريخ وإنما تتكلم وبكل أسف عن الحاضر التعس تلذي نعيش فيه، وبرغم قسوة النص إلا أن سعد الله ونوس نجح في صياغته وحبكته بكل حرفية يستحق عليها خمس نجوم صافيات,positive,ar

"This is one of those movies that I've seen so many times that I can quote most of it. Some of the lines in this movie are just unbeatable. I particularly enjoy watching him stumble and fall while drunk, go out to the fancy restaurant drunk and the part with the moose.I don't know how many times I have seen this sequence but it's funny every time. From the moment Arthur gets to Susan's Dad's place to the bit with the moose, you pretty much laugh the whole time. I remember watching the out-takes regarding the bit with the moose. It went down just like I'd imagined it'd be like. They were all laughing so hard it was difficult for them to film it.The late Sir John Gielgud was a wonderful addition to this. His demeanor, his one-liners and the way he handled Arthur were all equally hilarious. It's always a funny moment when he whacks him over the head with his hat or tells him he's a spoiled little ____. I laugh every time I listen to the ""I'm going to have a bath"" and the lines that follow.",positive,en

As soon as Condor realized that they would not be able to get us out of Frankfurt, they sent our luggage to baggage claim and arranged for a shuttle bus to the hotel they paid for. Everything went extremely smoothly for such an unexpected delay (mechanical problems with the plane). Once on the plane, Condor allowed everyone to use the premium entertainment options, which meant I had plenty of movies to watch on the way back. When I requested the compensation guaranteed by EU regulations for long flight delays, Condor immediately replied that they would reimburse me. I ended up essentially paying nothing for a transatlantic flight during the busiest time of the year! I would feel comfortable flying on Condor again knowing that they will help make my journey smooth even if unanticipated problems occur.",positive,en

"This hotel has very good things going for it like modern spaces, good restaurant (Market), pleasant front lobby Staff, but similar to other Ws I have visited in the past, the ""trend"" factor kills the hotel experience. In the evenings the small lobby bar gets completely packed with crowds of noisy people who come to the hotel to party. So forget about your night's sleep or using the lobby bar for a nice drink or some bar food.No space. You need to recluse yourself in your room and ask for room service (very limited menu). So you are a prisoner in your own room. A hotel with bouncers, need I say more?
Location is very good, right in the Theater district, but that also means noise. Thursday and Friday nights were particularly bad around 2 am when the lines of people to get in and out the W lobby bar, were very very noisy, waking me up both nights. I was on a lower floor facing the main entrance, so I guess that other rooms will be less noisy.
Front Staff very helpful but they have a problem with cleaning Staff. It appears that there is no supervision after rooms are made and they are not very thorough.
The rooms are very modern with odd angles but I had all the amenities you could expect of an upgraded room, Bang& Olufssen CD/radio player, flat HD TV, Ipod and Bberry chargers and more. The bathroom is great with separate toilet room. Classy. The desk behind the bed is more a design excuse than a desk. It is so crowded you cannot even place your laptop on the desk. I guess the hotel is for trendy types more than business people, leisure rather than business.
If you are looking to party in style, then this is your hotel, but if you are going for business there are better alternatives. Having said this I will probably return and try another type of room and see if I had a bad week with the crowd noise. The quality of the hotel deserves a second chance.",positive,en

"The wife found this place somehow and was desperate for us to check it out on our next visit to Vegas. I was a little hesitant but the Neon Museum was a home run in my book.

I think that we planned everything just right as we got there at dusk and by the time our tour started, the old signs were coming back to life. It was really cool seeing all the old sign in various forms of repair. The cost of refurbishing a neon sign is significant so that it will be a long time before they can all be returned to their original glory. Our tour guide was enthusiastic and very knowledgeable on all things neon and Las Vegas. \n\nIt is out of the way, and a little pricy but I would return if we were visiting Vegas with people that had never been before.

"I stayed in the hotel for 5 days in 2008 and really liked it. It is a basic hotel: no fancy rooms or service. What I think is really important is that it was cleaned every single day and that it is located really close to The Empire State Building and the major sub stations. Also, there are plenty of options for food nearby. One negative thing is that they don't offer wi-fi in the room. There is in the lobby, but it is not really fast. No big deal, since I went to the hotel only to take a shower and sleep. I would definitely recommend this hotel. Great value.",negative,en

"We undertook a great deal of research and spoke to many previous visitors to the city - the key advice was ""don't spend a fortune on your hotel room as you'll hardly be in it!""
Ok, point taken - but I also wanted somewhere that I could at least chill and relax after pounding the pavements for 5 days.
We were lucky enough to snag an amazing FaceBook deal which gave us a 40% discount on our stay + an upgrade to an exec suite! What a deal - we were on the 18th floor looking West over Chelsea (if you want to avoid some of the street inevitable noise from 6th avenue request a high floor room at the rear of the building).
From the door man, through to the check-in plus all of the many members of the team we met during our stay EVERYONE was warm, genuine, friendly and helpful. The rooms were immaculate and the facilities excellent.
We found the location to be really good - 2 blocks to the subway for up town/the Village/or downtown. Reasonably easy to grab a cab and many, many places within walking distance. Unless you are willing to really splurge and stay on Madison or 5th up near the Park, then this is a perfect area from which to explore.
Always managed to grab a free coffee in the morning but didn't make the wine hour. The Food Parc next door was good for a take out breakfast.
We covered masses of ground in the city - the food/bars which were highlights include
Eatly - Italian/American food retailer / restaurant on 23rd
Jane in the Village
The Cookshop in Chelesa
Daniel - 3 Mitchelin stars - unbeatable
Lamb's Bar - cocktails
The Essex - lower East side for brunch - book and go early
Ellen's Stardust Diner - great fun
And a special note for Big Apple Greeters. We were lucky enough to be matched with Ross a guy who has a love for his city. We really loved our 3 hours walking round the Village which ended with a wonderful lunch in Tony's for a genuine NYC burger in the East Village.
BAG is a wonderful charity and I truly hope that they continue to give more and more visitors a taste of the real NYC.
The subway - $29 for a weekly ticket - the best deal we got in our visit. We were all over the place using this ticket - on buses and subway. The system is SO easy to use and as others have said, if you even look slightly lost someone will help you. My OH was gobsmacked when someone stopped me on day 3 and asked for help understanding the subway system!
We loved the city - it wont be long till we are back!",positive,en
"Hotel very handy to all the tourist attractions and shopping and whilst it was very clean (our room had been recently refurbished) we were slightly disappointed that there was only a bedside table and lamp on one side of the bed even though there would have been room for them on both sides, the bed, however was very comfortable. Although the hotel is situated in a busy street the room was very quiet, no street or traffic noise. There was a lack of shelving in the bathroom, again even though there would have been room for some, the basin was free standing, there was only one small shelf above the toilet but this was taken up with towels etc, there were no hooks or rails to hang your bathrobe or clothes on. Another disappointment was that we were quoted the rate by phone but were not told there was a long list of taxes to be added on top of the price. Breakfast was included in the rate (which is great in a strange city when you don't have to go out looking for somewhere to eat first thing in the morning) and was a perfectly adequate continental style breakfast, self help. The staff (desk, cleaning and bag checkin man) were very friendly and helpful and the Conecierge arranged our airport transfer which arrived very promptly and delivered us to JFK in good time.",neutral,en

"Этот отзыв посвящается руководству данного фитнес клуба. Мне сотрудники сказали, что проживаете в Краснодаре и не знаете, что происходит. \nМое впечатление о данной компании формировалось некоторое время. \n1. В первый раз познакомилась в июне 2022 года. Не приобрела абонемент, т.к в зале ужасная вентиляция, а пришла я вечером, когда свежего воздуха не было от слова совсем\n2. В 2023 году решила дать шанс, т.к это ближайший фитнес зал к моему дому. Со мной общался менеджер Владислав, который перешел на общение в мессенджеры и высылал мне стопку аудио сообщений, не спросив комфортно ли мне их прослушивать\n2. Сходила на пробную тренировку и вроде все ок, попросила Владислава подготовить договор, чтобы утром я пришла и перед тренировкой все оплатила. Сотрудник не отвечал два дня и естественно мое занятие отменилось \n3. Писала далее 2 дня подряд Владиславу, просила подготовить снова договор к 7:30 10.05, чтобы утром перед тренировкой я смогла оплатить. Какого было мое удивление, когда девочки на ресепшене сказали, что никакого договора на мое имя нет, впустить не могут. Я простояла 20 мин и ждала решение моего вопроса. К сожалению, мне так и не удалось ничего оплатить, а девушкам большое спасибо за понимание. \n4. Сотрудник каждый раз мне рассказывал после своих ошибок, что был на выходном либо о том, что отработал 4 смены по 12 часов \n\nИтак, риторический вопрос. Мне как клиенту, интересно знать кто и сколько отработал? Я готова платить деньги, чтобы стать клиентом, а натыкаюсь на ошибки и невнимательность менеджера, которые портят все впечатление о всей организации\n\n",negative,ru

"Stellar local beer list, with flights a plenty! There are two pages of beers with a bizarre rule that flights can only be ordered from one page or the other. Not to worry, just order a flight from each. Served on WI shaped wood trays, they add a nice amount of kitsch. Being in the cheesehead state, we had to go big or go home on the dairy, so we started with the Glacial plate, a tasty trio paired with a cherry jam, walnuts and crackers. The pickled egg was super spicy and super rubbery. Do not attempt.\n\nNext up was the prime rib sandwich, which we mistakenly thought was going to be an actual piece of prime rib versus the mish mash of leftover, loose meat pieces of last night's roast. Housemade cheese curds exploded into a slightly soggy mess, but fried cheese is fried cheese, and pretty good regardless. Then, the Norwegian salmon salad, which smelled too fishy for my taste. Served with an overcooked, rubbery, deviled egg and a tarragon vinaigrette, it left more to be desired. Going back to another flight for dessert, we rolled out of Madison with full bellies. The Old Fashioned is a place for cheese and beer, but dinner can be had elsewhere.",negative,en

"I haven't stayed at the Helmsley since the Queen was still ruling her hotel. With our annual trip into the city for Memorial Day, we decided to enjoy a springtime view of Central Park and booked a Junior Suite with Park view. Although these rooms are described as being on higher floors, we wound up in room 1000 and were not happy with the 10th floor view into the trees along Central Park South. When I asked at the desk for a move, I was told they were fully booked. Not a happy camper. But, I was happy with the room rate - booked online early and we stayed the 2 nights for $720. Not bad for a very large room with a view (albeit one blocked by trees) of the park and the beauty of sunrise and sunset against the buildings that run along side. They charged my credit card for the full amount of the stay a week before our arrival and put a $100 hold on the card for miscellaneous expenses which took a week to be released. Both practices are unusual these days.
Although the room was very close to the elevator and there was the usual all night NY traffic outside - the room was incredibly quiet and a room darkening shade closed off the light from the picture window. The one thing that was strange was the large glowing blue insignia on the flat screen tv that was enough to blind you - I placed the room service menu to block it - otherwise we would have had a very bright night light.
Because I joined the I Prefer guest benefit program, based on a note I found here on TripAdvisor, a call to the desk with my membership number got me free internet and the signal was consistent and easily accessed.
Otherwise, staying here was a step back in time. The lobby and rooms are getting frayed. At first glance, our room was lovely, but a closer look showed the peeling wallpaper, dents in the walls, chips in the tub, and worn carpet. A small fridge under the counter in the bath allowed us to stow some water bottles, but after searching for the traditional vending areas and ice machine, without success, we called the desk and asked where we could find ice and we told we had to call room service. So I'd have to wait for a delivery and tip for ice? I don't think so. A quick trip around the corner to Angela's Deli got us ice and some great sandwiches for half the cost of room service and no tip required.
Because the weekend was unusually hot for spring, we wound up using cabs a bit more than we normally would, but there is a subway station directly across the street. The friendly doorman made grabbing a cab a breeze. If you're up for a carriage ride, they line up across the street and bike taxis into the park are plentiful.
Everyone we encountered was very welcoming and professional, from the front desk to the doorman to the bellman. The only problem we encountered with staffing was quantity not quality. We had really long waits to check in and to check our bag when we arrived before our room was ready. Then 2 more long waits to store and then reclaim it, as we checked out before spending the day in the park and returned to grab it for the trip home. The bell staff is too thin - had we been on a tight time schedule to catch a plane/train we would have missed it - took us at least 30 minutes each time as we waited in line for the single bellman on duty to retrieve/deliver luggage to rooms or storage. Warning - leave time for checking in and checking a bag if you expect to dash off to a matinee or if you need help with storing or retrieving bags. Also, the desk staff isn't adequate for the demands in this hotel. Many guests were interested in changing currency and some needed interpreters - really slowed things down and there just weren't enough people there do do the job efficiently.
There must be adequate housekeeping staff however. Our room was kept in spotless condition. Linens were fresh and they offer you the option of having them changed each day - or ""going green"" by delaying by placing a placard on the bed. The bath towels were unusually large - and fluffy :) A call to housekeeping brought extra pillows quickly and we were given the choice of feathers or foam.
One of the advantages of this location is easy access to some of our favorite spots to eat. The Boathouse Restaurant is close by in the park and Mickey Mantles is just a few doors down on central park south for a late dinner or snack. Its also an easy jaunt to Lincoln Center and the Museums up along the park. The location combined with the price relative to the other hotels on the southern end of the park raise my rating from Poor to Good. This old lady needs and face-lift and more staff to warrant a Very Good rating.",negative,en

So, I went into Princess Raccoon wary of what I was going to see. Boy! Was I knocked out! 'Raccoon' is Suzuki's attempt at a musical, using the elements of Japanese opera mixed in with many modern elements (both Audial and Visual), Raccoon is a treat from start to finish. The lead actor, Joe Ogdari, proves that he's one of the hottest actors in Japan these days in this role. I have to admire that the younger Japanese actors still take roles that take place in Feudal-times Japan, dressing up in Samurai gear to full effect. The story itself does get a bit confusing, if you don't follow it really closely, but even if you don't, prepare yourself for the treasures that Princess Raccoon has.",positive,en

"Avoid these people at all costs if you want a simple broadband set up completed in a reasonable timescale. Not only do they not deliver on their promises to turn up and install broadband, their customer service staff, which in itself is a massive oxymoron, lie through their teeth to get rid of you. Their communication is appalling, they have no sense of service and don't even have the common decency to apologise when they screw up. Do like I should have done and avoid them at all costs unless you're prepared to wait weeks, hoping you may be able to get on line. If they promise any dates for service, don't plan anything around it as you will be disappointed. It's a shame there is no option for zero stars.

"Покупал костюм на свадьбу на 29.06.2023, выбрали и оплатили 03.06.2023\nПредложили бесплатный подшив, обещали крайний срок 24.06.2023\nПозвонили мне 23.06.2023 и сказали, что костюм ещё не брали в работу и смогут сделать 28.06.2023, сказал, что так не пойдёт, договорились на 25.06.2023\nВ итоге ещё пара звонков с приветствием ""Здравствуйте, как Ваше настроение?

"Pretty sneaky, Zanders.\n\nThree friends and I went to Zanders tonight for dinner. We all ordered essentially the same thing (burgers & fries). The waitress asked what kind of fries we'd like, regular or sweet potato. My three companions went with the sweet potato fries, and I picked regular but asked for a veggie patty instead of meat. \n\nWhen it came time for the bill, I noticed my bill came to about $2 more than I was expecting - as it turned out, they charged me $1.50 to sub in a veggie patty. Being the cheapskate I am (hey, at least I admit it), I mentioned that it was lame for them to charge me $1.50 extra when their veggie burger was the same price as their beef and turkey burgers. My three friends looked at their bills, and realized they'd been charged $1.50 for \""subbing\"" sweet potato fries. \n\nThere hadn't been any notes on the menu that there'd be charges, so we brought it up to the waitress when she came to get the bill. Her response was \""My bad, it was totally my job to tell you. Sorry!\"" -- but she didn't offer to take off the charge or, if she wasn't authorized to do so, talk to a manager. \n\nPoor customer service equaled poor tip - we knocked $6 ($1.50 x 4 people) off what we would have left her. I feel kind of bad for doing it, but at the same time the menu should advise of extra charges and/or the server shouldn't ask if you want something that costs extra without telling you.\n\nThe unfortunate part is that the food was actually really good - I got the Tex-Mex burger with a black bean patty (good texture on the patty, tasty salsa/avocado, and a surprisingly spicy and delicious sauce). My friends ordered the turkey berry, salmon, and crab cake burgers, which they all enjoyed. Despite the tastiness, I probably won't go back - there are plenty of places I can get a good veggie burger without having to spend $12 on it. \n\n2.5 stars, a solid 4 if going on food alone.",negative,en

"I really wanted to give this place that 4th star, but the customer service in here was lacking. \n\nDon't get me wrong it wasn't terrible, but the two fellas behind the counter seemed a little disjointed. When I first walked in they were trying to figure out how to get someone's tab settled; either the machine wasn't working, they didn't know how to use it, or just plain forgot to charge the customer in the first place. It also seemed like only one of the two bartenders knew how to work cash register. During this time of \""transaction confusion\"" my friend and I sat there just looking around waiting to be helped. This was probably just a few minutes, but at least throw me a menu or give a brief cocktail rundown while you're waiting to settled someone's tab. Just a thought.\n\nBeyond this little hiccup, which I'm assuming doesn't happen that often, the drinks were actually pretty good. Oak & Ivy has a great selection of whiskey, which they should, being this is a Whiskey Based Craft Cocktail lounge. I didn't order a craft cocktail, but decided to go with a glass of Four Roses Single Barrel whiskey on the rocks, I could have sipped these bad boys all night! My partner in crime went with the \""Sazerac\"", a Peychaud's soaked sugar cube crushed in a house blend misted bucket and stirred with Bulleit Rye. I didn't try a sip of this and now as I write this, I'm kicking myself. Next time Oak & Ivy, next time. \n\nBesides the brief brain fart in customer service at the beginning of this experience, Oak & Ivy is that little gem you might pass by as you wander through Container Park.

"Я обратилась в банк МТС- Ростов-на-Дону, 339 Стрелковая дивизия,д.5 60б, за получением перевода Золотая Корона. Специалист в банке был вежлив ,но уверил меня,что перевод можно получить только при наличии дебетовой карты банка. Я согласилась на открытие карты(как позже оказалось меня обманули с самого начала и для получения перевода карта не нужна,Карта дебетовая МТС ), все прошло нормально с получением, карту я решила оставить и попробовать поработать с банком. Но через неделю банк подключил мне без моего ведома и согласия услугу Лекарственный полис, хотя изначально в банке она была отключена и меня уверили, что никаких услуг дополнительных нет по карте,включая отсутствие страховки( мне сразу же пришла смс, что услуга Лекарственный полис отключена, там же в банке пришла), как и отсутствие абонентской платы( как позже опять же оказалось она есть при определенных условиях,а в отделении банка сказали, что карта бесплатная, хотя я дважды уточнила) . Отключить услугу Лекарственный полис оказалось делом не простым, в приложении она не отображается.По короткому номеру ее отключить нельзя, вместо отключения приходит сообщение - ошибочка вышла (так и написано в смс от банка! ) .В службе поддержки в приложении услугу просто не нашли, но сказали, что может она и есть и рекомендовали обратиться в службу поддержки, позвонив туда.Как оказалось при звонке в поддержку, мне подключили в банке все-таки страховку Ренессанс, которая мне не была нужна, и в отделении банка меня уверили, что ее нет, вот и получается вроде она подключена по договору.В итоге отключить ее нельзя, потому что по факту ее нет, но в договоре она вроде как есть. Сотрудники банка вежливые,поддержка тоже, но навязывание услуг, которые вроде работают, а вроде и нет(и которые мне не нужны), и отсутствие открытого информирования в филиале банка о предоставляемых услугах, тарифах карты,возможностях переводов и т.д,отбивает желание работать с банком.Единственный плюс это очень хорошая поддержка по телефону, все что могут операторы делают, поддержка на высоте, надо отдать должное. Я еще даже не успела попробовать нормально поработать с банком, как уже возникло две неприятных ситуации.Карту буду закрывать все-таки, вопрос не в карте, карта сама по себе возможно неплохая, вопрос в работе отделения банка в Ростове, начинать работу с обмана клиента в вопросе получения перевода так себе идея.",negative,ru
"I fly a lot, actually I'm one of those who commute every week. I find its hard to say I will never fly this airline again as: 1) I have to be flexible with the availability and 2) it would probably delete all options as there will most likely be unfortunate circumstances one time or another. Air Berlin is in a league of its own. The flights are usually delayed out of Budapest and not that its great, but its doable. But what I don't get is the incredible lack of communication. No one informs the 20 some passengers that the connecting flight will be there waiting. They don't at all care about the stress the passengers are in. Side note: If you are unlucky to be parked in another terminal (20 minutes left to your departure), they will not take any effort whatsoever in informing you where to go or even update the screens signalling delays. Then you're hit with a one lane open security control, again they don't care if the flight you're about to take is leaving in 5 minutes its slow. Yesterdays flight, once we got in the bus, the driver hacked this thing causing most of us to almost fall over and then once out of the bus, they refused to open the doors cause there was another group let in from another plane in the connecting terminal. Now we were running extremely late and running to the gate. All gates had the destinations show on the screen as is usually the case, except for the one going to Stockholm, so we ran up and asked and were brushed off. They tell us to go outside and what do we find? A bus parked right by the gate a plane right in front of us and one far to the right and again, nothing is marked. I mean, when you fly Ryanair or Wizz Air or any of these cheepy ones, its all marked. Why is this so difficult to figure out? Well obviously it is not, it is due to the lack of care. They think their passengers are a painful must. No communication whatsoever. All this anxiety and stress for the passengers, especially when you're taking the last flight out is unnecessary. Last time I flew them, my luggage got stuck in Berlin for 4 days. I have one more ticket in my pre-purchased pile and then that's it. Never again. All the issues with Air Berlin could be mitigated with care and communication. But I guess they have so many they don't have to worry about it.",negative,en

I am jumping on the deep pigment lipstick bandwagon and I needed some advice.\n\nI searched around a few different brands, Benefit, Bare Minerals, etc... but settled on and Urban Decay display set up in the middle of an aisle.

"We have just stayed 6 nights at this property, our 2nd visit in a year. This time we booked into the Fairway Suite and were very disappointed. This suite is in the main section of the hotel, and it is in desperate need of a refurbishment + a redesign of the room. We travelled as 2 adults + 1 child. Our daughter slept in a rollaway in the sitting area of the suite. The main bedroom had doors, but for our daughter having to sleep in the sitting area, it was hard not to disturb her. The bathroomns in this room are in severe need of a major refurbishment. They are dinghy & the lighting is very poor. I could hardly put my make up on with the poor lighting each morning! The shower curtain is disgusting. They couldn't even put a nice pretty curtain in the bathroom, which was terrible, being in a suite. The suite is badly designed, with only 1 bathtub, and no door closing off the bathroom area for privacy (if others are in the sitting room). The 2nd bathroom has only a sink and toilet (no shower or bath), which we found useless. There is too much open space in the suite, and not enough wardrobe/drawer space for clothes. No luggage racks to put suitcases on. We looked at 2 adjoining rooms in the 'new' tower section, but this would have been more expensive, and we weren't really that impressed with the new rooms either.
One night we were woken up at 3am with a sound like a jack hammer outside our room! When I called the front desk I was told it was the pipes in the hotel, and that they would have to call the maintenance guy out. It was a very annoying sound. In addition our bed sheets were filthy & stained on arrival, and after 3 nights I finally had to put a card on our bed to ask housekeeping to change them. The pilot light wasn't working either on arrival for our fireplace, and lots of things were not in our room, such as teaspoons for tea, tea bags, etc. We had to keep asking for things to be brought to the room.
Starbucks coffee in the hotel: why can't Americans make a good coffee? Having lived in Sydney for the past 14 years, I find the coffee absolutely disgusting in the US, and this includes all the coffee at the hotel. The drip coffee should just be thrown out, and the hotel restaurants should have proper expresso machines, and actually train the staff on how to make a perfect coffee. There is an art to it you know! I couldn't get a decent coffee at the hotel, including Starbucks. I tried ordering a soy cappucino, but the girl frothed up the milk so much that I just had a blob of foam on top of my coffee.I actually had to bring my coffee back to her, and ask her to remake it. The beans aren't right either. The key to good coffee is to buy the right beans, and whip the milk so that it is silky, NOT foamy! If the hotel could get this right, they would have people standing in a line. If Starbucks can't find the right beans, then kick them out and find the good beans first. Have grown up in Texas, and visiting family in Austin, we just couldn't get a good cup of coffee anywhere, including the resort! btw, the drip coffee is putrid. It tastes like dirty dish water!!
Having said the above, the hotel staff was very nice and accommodating. The hotel is always beautifully decorated at Christmas time, and the ice skating rink is fun too. The only gripe about ice skating is that we paid $5 for a smores kit, and were only given 4 marshmallows for our kids to roast. That was a rip off! How hard is it to put a small bag of mashmallows in this kit? Surely it wouldn't cost the resort that much money.
They gym was very nice too. Didn't have time unfortunately to try the spa.",negative,en

"A landing in Seattle was not possible due to weather conditions. The flight was diverted to Vancouver. The passengers were then all accommodated overnight in hotels. The crisis management for the onward flight was a disaster. We were initially told that we would receive an email with information, which did not happen. Instead, we were told in the hotel that we should all fly back to Seattle the next afternoon at 16:30. Since many of us had booked connecting flights, it was not at all clear whether we could travel onward from Seattle on the same day, especially since the plane was not scheduled to arrive until shortly before 6 pm. There was zero information and the Condor phone hotlines in Germany and USA said they were not responsible. At the airport, there was no Condor information booth and the airport information desks had not received any information from Condor. One heard everywhere only ""Yes, this Frankfurt flight. There are quite a few people asking, but we don't know anything."" All passengers lost at least one whole travel day and those who did not get a connection in the evening even two. It was a disaster and all very nerve-wracking. You certainly don't need that a second time!",negative,en

"We had a great stay at this hotel in October 2011. LOVED the location. This trip we tried the service where you get an upgrade( you pay for) if one available on arrival. we will never use this again as all around the USA we found we were not offered the upgrade and had more success when we left it to chance and did not agree to pay.
Back to the hotel itself it was clean and quiet and staff helpful.
we did not use the hotel restaurant.
Our order of drinks and cookies prior to arrival was not noted and had not arrived but did once we rang the front desk.
On discharge from this hotel we asked for a taxi and the doorman and his 2 mates ( all at front door) called in a car and before we knew it we were put in the car and bags loaded. we then noticed it was not a taxi we asked him to stop and asked what the price would be he said a very inflated price and then dropped it considerably ( more than half) when we asked to get out. we also loudly complained that he was not a registered taxi and he said he worked for the hotel!!!
He took us where we wanted to go and was helpful and we eventually got the trip for the same price we paid for taxi when we arrived but I feel this practice is deceptive . it is well and good to use a car service when the customer knows this is happening but we had asked for a taxi. we are 2 middle asked ladies travelling together and certainly for a few moments felt unsafe and taken advantage of. If this is a practice sanctioned by the hotel management it is not acceptable.
We would definately stay at this hotel again but will be wiser next time.",positive,en
"The Adolphus is a very nice 100-year old updated hotel. Stayed one night with my wife and enjoyed the spacious lobby, gift shop and quick elevators. Be aware, however, that the restaurants are pricey. We had breakfast at the Bistro and the food was good, but the on-site menu prices didn't match the on-line prices. Of course, on-site prices were higher. Also be aware that if you purchase an on-line upgrade from eStandby Upgrades you may not get it once there. I purchased a $20 food and beverage upgrade for $16, and upon check-out was told it was not honored. After a discussion, it was finally honored but one should not have to argue for a $4 upgrade at the Adolphus. It made the hotel look cheap. One more thing, the king deluxe room was nice enough, but really no better than a La Quinta I recently stayed at. I actually enjoyed my recent stay at the next door Magnolia Hotel much better, especially the complimentary breakfast there!",neutral,en

The location of the hotel is perfect, situated in the less 'touristy' part of the Wharf, with awesome views of Alcatraz and the Golden Gate Bridge. It is right next to the cable car turnaround, which takes you to a lot of the main attractions including Lombard Street and Union Square. It is also within walking distance of North Beach which has a great selection of cafes and restaurants.

They are very good at selling their products to you but not so good when it comes to resolving issues. First bad experience was when they lost my device in the post and had the audacity to accuse me of lying about the device not arriving. Then they proceeded to continue taking money from my account and refused to blacklist the device until I got the police involved. That was about 4 years ago. As I'm writing, I am stranded abroad with no mobile data and without the ability to make calls. Thank god I'm with a friend who has a WiFi hotspot otherwise I'd be screwed! Spent approximately 3 hours with customer services only to be told they could do anything due to a technical error. Didn't say what they would do next. Just apologised.

Have two TV's was the best and my husband would sit in the living room type area while we got ready on the other side. Wireless access is available only at the poolside and cabana BUT if you have a room like we do, near the cabana, you actually pick up the wireless in your room (I'm in my room typing this) . Request a poolside room if that is important to you. The pool is nice and clean and the cabana is right there. The rooms are VERY clean. The staff is more than accomidating when you have a problem.

"On sait bien que dans les films avec Fred Astaire le scénario est loin d'être la partie la plus travaillée, mais il y a quand même des limites au j'm'en foutisme des scénaristes. Certes quelques numéros musicaux ont un léger parfum Busby Berkeley et Rita Hayworth n'a probablement jamais été aussi belle, mais dieu que l'ensemble est pesant. Les relations entre personnages apparaissent comme un sommet de ringardise et d'immaturité. Les films de Gene Kelly ont globalement, beaucoup mieux vieilli que ceux de Fred Astaire, celui-là en est une illustration de plus.",negative,fr

"Quelle déception! La bande-annonce envoyait du lourd, le résultat n'est pas du tout à la hauteur. Le premier épisode était bien mieux. Il était sympathique, amusant, divertissant, avec un couple Nicolas Cage/Eva Mendes très en forme. Ici, on a un Nicolas Cage qui fait n'importe quoi, une Violante Placido transparente, et un Johnny Whitworth aux allures de Kurt Russell des années 80. Le Ghost Rider est affreusement mal fait, et complètement ridicule. Un comble! Roarke/Le Malin a perdu tout son charisme et toute son infamie, et ce n'est pas la faute à Ciaran Hinds, celui-ci n'étant pas aidé par l'écriture de son personnage, dans un scénario désastreux. Et puis il y en a marre de cette réalisation hystérique, agaçante, avec une caméra qui part dans tous les sens, des effets ridicules, qui rendent fou le spectateur! RAS LE BOL de cette façon de faire avec les pieds! On peut rajouter aussi ce manque cruel d'action, le ridicule du clan des moines à capuche, la laideur des effets spéciaux, la durée rikiki du film qui renforce l'impression de travail bâclé, la scène de conjuration de malédiction farfelue et affligeante, et la scène finale navrante. Ça se confirme, Mark Neveldine et Brian Taylor sont nuls, comme leur(s) films(s). 0/5",negative,fr

"It shocks me that this place hasn't been reviewed yet. It's been a staple in the Mill/College/Baseline community for a long time now.\n\nBSP is one of those places where you go, you like it, but you realize something is missing and you just don't know what it is.\n\nI still don't know what it is and I first went there in 2002.\n\nThe inside is very nice, tvs are situated nicely around the tables, food is okay and there is outdoor seating. I never find myself going here to watch games though or even to go grab a meal.\n\nI was here for an ALCS game in 2004 and it was the most packed I've ever seen it. I haven't seen it that way since, not even for football.\n\nNow I go in on a very irregular basis because various softball teams I played on have had their post games here. \n\nI notice on weeknights it has somewhat of a Cheers atmosphere. Regulars sitting up at the bar who know waitresses (who also double as bartenders) by name. \n\nI think the inside might just be too luxurious though. Furniture looks more like a restaurant and I think the average sports fan (and this is a sports bar) likes more of a dive bar feel.\n\nI couldn't understand why Doc & Eddy's, which is right up the road, gets far more patrons for sporting events. It's a more divey bar with similar food. I know it's got more to do with it than having pool tables and air hockey.\n\nThe Woodshed is also walking distance to the west. \n\nI think BSP just toes the line between casual restaurant and sports bar and that might be what's hurting it. Looks like a place you might take your girlfriend for dinner rather than your buddies for a playoff game.\n\nIt's so well situated between Kiwanis park and numerous apartment complexes that it should be far more popular during game times. \n\nI've just been in far too many times when people at the bar exceed people at tables. \n\nI still can't put my finger on it...",negative,en

"This movie deserves the 10 I'm giving it.But it's not the 10 that you'd give to movies like 'The Godfather' or 'Goodfellas' or 'Psycho'. This is the kind of 10 you give to a movie which just makes you laugh,over and over again! It's the most horribly written and directed movie, yet it doesn't fail to entertain. It has the most amateur effects, yet you enjoy every moment! I saw this movie today on TV, and I didn't want to move away! Read the following dialogue to know why!(Whole college is standing around Manisha,who has just undergone a rape attempt and the guys who attempted the rape are asking for forgiveness)Bad Guy 1: Please forgive us! Bad guy 2: Yes,we won't do it again. (No response from Manisha) Akshay: Come on,forgive them! Manisha: I don't know... Akshay: You are a beautiful woman, and even dead men can get aroused by you! And these are living young males! Don't blame them!Pancholi: Yeah Manisha.. Manisha(To Suniel): What if they tried to rape your girlfriend??? Suniel: I'd break their hands,legs and kill them.But anyways,just forgive them..Akshay: Yeah if you don't forgive them then it will be as though you are too arrogant about your beauty!Now that is a true masterpiece of a dialogue! This movie never fails to entertain, mainly because there are so many goofs and unrealistic situations! The bad guy (Munish) can do basically anything..He can blow a sandstorm from his mouth, or he can get a motorcycle from his backside and just as easily make it disappear again. Every actor takes turns to speak..One line from Akshay,then from Suniel, then from Arshad, then Aftab, then Nigam. It's the main rule followed by the director, so that equal screen time is given to each guy. And then there's the all powerful pendant, which can cause even a speeding car to go right through you without you being harmed! All these things make it an enjoyable movie, and I can watch it over and over again. I think this movie can go into the comedy hall of fame if there is one..The only problem is that it wasn't trying to be funny.",positive,en

Our mouths watered at the sight, since they looked so good. \n\nThe meat jun meat was really tender and had great flavor. Although, I thought it wasn't quite authentic since it had batter plus egg. I've typically had it with just the egg. \n\nMy husband got the spicy noodle soup with beef and vegetables. The noodles had great flavor and the base had the right amount of spicy.\n\nI would have knocked it down to a 4 because of the Meat Jun, but the service was so good that it bumped it back up to a 5. He was even offering otter pops for dessert.\n\nAloha!!",positive,en

Positive:
Location is great! Close to metro, easy to get form JFK. Close to grocery stores and restaurants.
Free WiFi.
Staff is nice and helpful.
Issues:
Cockroaches
Street noise
Heater did not work
Dirty floors
Elevator is unreliable.
Would never stay again: 3 inch cockroaches, woke up thinking I have a mouse on a table, NOT a mouse just a gigantic cockroach! Very disturbing!
Street noise is horrible! Is it that hard to put noise protective windows? Besides the loud car noise, woke up at 3am from a woman screaming for help, she sounded like she was physically violated, who can go to sleep after that?
Heater never started working, just blew cool air. Unfortunately for me the temperature dropped that evening, the additional thin cotton spread did not save the night, I had to layer myself with clothing I had, it was a rough night. To the management: it is a middle of October, shouldn't it be a rule to provide an additional winter version of a bed spread/comforter starting in fall?
Dirty floors: visible crumbs all over the floor, makes me just think what else hasn't been cleaned that I can not see???
Elevator is hard to get: it is either full or one has to wait for 20 minutes, had to use the narrow stairs, not much fun dragging the suitcase up and down.

"Although we often visit San Diego we stayed here on this occasion only because we were just here for a couple of days before boarding a ship and the location seemed convenient. Everything started out ok, easy check-in, pleasant staff at the front desk.
Once in the room we found that the balcony door was stuck and would only open a few inches. It also would not close properly. That night was very windy so we were awake most of the night listening to the door rattle. We could also hear everything that went on in the hallways.
We had booked a room that included breakfast, so the next morning went down to the restaurant with our coupon. After being seated, the waitress came by and on seeing the coupon, grabbed our menus and told us we didn't have any choice about what we would be served other than the manner in which our eggs would be cooked. She also made it very clear and I do mean VERY clear that the coupon did not include her tip.
Great start to the day, but when we returned to our room it got better yet, since our keycards wouldn't work. The maid was in the hallway and when we told her the problem she said there was nothing she could do and the problem was caused by carrying the keycards close to a cell phone. Interesting observation inasmuch as my wife's keycard was never near her phone and I don't carry a cell phone.
To rectify the problem we had to go back down to the front desk. There were only two people on duty to handle people checking in and out and no one who could handle this sort of problem. As a result we had to wait in line for over half an hour to address the issue. When we did manage to speak to someone she couldn't understand how this could happen and seemed to think we didn't know how to work a door handle. We told her the maid's story about the cell phones and suddenly all was clear for her, yes indeed the problem was caused by cell phones. The fact that I don't carry one and that my wife's phone was never near the keycard didn't matter, the problem had been solved. All we had to do was go back to our room and she would send someone up to deal with the matter. I indicated that I wasn't too pleased to have to wait in a line for over half an hour to discuss the problem and that I wasn't going to stand around in the hallway waiting for someone to show up. She then decided that she could issue new keycards.
We returned to the room and miraculously the cards worked. We got ready to go out, waited around a bit, but no one ever did show up at our room, at least not while we were there. Went out for the day and also went out for dinner that evening. That night we again could hear everyone entering and exiting their rooms, every noise in the hall as well as the ship arriving and a variety of announcements made by the ship's staff.
Next morning same rigamarole re breakfast although different waitress who didn't make an issue out of her tip. Easy check-out via voicemail.

You pay well and supposedly get a high class hotel, only to discover all the small things are not included, not available, or require extra pay.
WIFI included? No! Need to pay extra.
Breakfast included? ""No, but we have a restaurant downstairs""... Even in the room, you have coffee for only one cup of regular coffee and one cup of decaf :(.
Refrigerator? Nope. Microwave? Nope.
Free parking for customers? You would think, no? Well, no again. Feel free to use the parking lot across the street and pay another $13 for a 24 hour stay.
Almost any cheep hotel anywhere across the US will give you free WIFI, a refrigerator and microwave in the room, free parking, and more coffee than you will need, and sometimes a good breakfast included.

The hotel itself was amazing and the modern decor was fun. The shower was awesome, incredible amount of water pressure and the bath products were fabulous.
Being that we were coming in late at night (after 9 pm) and that they gave us the non-smoking room we requested, it seems rude to complain, but there was a woman's hair all over the bathroom of the room that we stayed in, which was ridiculously disgusting. I cleaned it myself, too tired after our airport debacle to go back downstairs to complain and wait for a new room, but in a hotel that's this high-caliber and priced accordingly, I found this unacceptable. Needless to say, I was not impressed, and was left with a negative impression of such a seemingly wonderful hotel.",negative,en

"Unlike all the other reviews on here, I am not going to give away any of the show! Instead, I will just list the highlights and some low-lights of the night! \n\nHighlights:\n\n-Been after Minh for a while to go and see this show, but each time we were in town there was always other things to do! \n-Reserving tickets is easy, and we were able to get tickets a couple of hours before the Sunday 8:00pm showing.\n-Ticket booth is not located inside of Caesars; instead, it is on the outside across from serendipity 3. \n-Outside door staff were friendly, inside some of the ushers were nice too.\n-It is true, try, and not sit in the first two rows unless you would like to be a part of the show!\n-Two words........... The Gazillionaire!!!!!\n-Get ready to laugh..... And do not be all-uptight! \n-The tent is so pretty inside and I love the feel of the old school circus minus the animals!\n-The bartenders \""creation of the day\"" looked and sounded yummi!\n-Bring cash for drinks!\n-The show was the BEST and it kept you wanting more after each act!!!!\n\nNow the Low-lights:\n-Not being told where the box office was located and having to walk through all of Caesars until we saw the signs outside.\n-The rows of wooden chairs are so close together that it was hard not to trip over your own feet (mind you I am 5-1).\n-If you have issues sitting shoulder to shoulder with a stranger, then maybe this show is not for you!\n-The AC is nice and cool until the show starts, then it is switched off and it is super hot inside. Even worse if the show is sold out!\n-Walking to the bar, I almost slipped on some water that was on the floor, told an usher who seemed not to care at all!\n-Encountered another usher who was rude and told me that the barline started on the right side of the bar not on the left.\n-Bar does not sell on tap water; instead, they have bottled which was $5.00 for a small. ummm pass!",positive,en
"Instant relief!
This product is amazing. I have sciatica and it has been getting progressively worse. I’ve tried yoga, stretches, medication, and massage with only minimal relief. I saw this and decided to give it a try. Easy to set up. Put on the sleep mask, laid down, asked Alexa to set a timer for 10 minutes and play some spa music, closed my eyes and laid my head in the hammock. I could immediately tell it was helping. Best stretch I ever had. After 10 minutes I was able to feel quite a bit of relief from the pain. I was able to get off the floor much easier. So simple, relaxing, and effective.

"Trip started off poorly when we called for courtesy van to pick us up and Union Station only to be told we would have to wait about a couple of hours. Once at the hotel, we found it to be older, run-down and an 'outside door' style. No elevators , so you lug up two flights of stairs to the room. Overall room was clean but the smoke alarm was dis-mantled and laying on our bed. Left a camera in the van, called front desk to ask them to call van driver immediately (before any fares to or from Union Station) .they refused. We went to front desk two times to ask them to call him , they refused and pleaded not good English-so alas...camera was gone ... The van drivers in general were rude, careening thru the DC streets, not acknowledging passengers and just mad at their Days Inn staff.
No wifi in rooms-(it was advertised as wifi in rooms) and no complimentary brkfst. Cold food and steep prices---This inn needs to have a manager retrain his staff on how to work and be personable with guests.

二つ購入しましたが、精度が悪すぎて電圧が出ているかどうかの参考にくらいしかなりません。 差し込むだけで便利そうかと思って購入しましたが、 ウェブサイトなどでこの類の製品を使って製品などをレビューし、 計測した電圧をのせている人がいますが、そういう用途には使うべきじゃないですね。 精度は、せめて小数点二桁目があるのだから、小数点一桁程度の精度は期待したかったですが、 電圧・電流両方で、10%以上の誤差が出ます。 価格考えればこんなものかもしれません。 あと、この機器自体が消費する電力による電圧降下もあるので、 充電時に挟んで使うような用途にも不適だと感じました。 電源と機器の組み合わせによっては、充電自体が出来なくなるレベルです。",negative,ja

"I was torn about this Marriott, because the rooms were not as nice as I have experienced at other Marriotts. However, the service and other ammenities helped to redeem the stay.
The rooms had the standard stuff (including the fabulous Marriott bed); there was nothing gross or wrong about them per se. However, they were on the smallish side and lacked some of the upgraded features I have found at other Marriott hotels, including upgraded lighting, ways to connect the television to your computer, and a flexible working area. Worst of all, though, was the total lack of outlets near the desk: to plug in my laptop I had to dive under the desk and plug into a wall outlet that had a 3-outlet extender in it that had only one open space.
That said, the hotel had some great features- a nice pool area, a great fitness center, and a stylish lobby. Best of all was the concierge lounge, which featured outstanding and friendly service in both the morning and evening, an excellent breakfast, and evening meal service that was enough for dinner. Truly excellent. The front desk service was also excellent, as was the valet service (fast and polite).
Location was fine- downtown is more fun, but this was close to where I had business, had easy access to the highway, and had places to eat nearby.
Overall, I think the rooms could use an upgrade, but their decent quality combined with superb service made for a solid stay.",positive,en

"The last time I was here was in December. I thought the food was spectacular. Today, three months later, not so much. Had the chicken biryani and the shrimp sag. Asked for the sag (spinach) to be made without dairy. There is another local restaurant that does this for me. Well they accommodated my request but the dish turned out to be flavorless. I didn't ask for the spices to be left out--just the dairy. So the shrimp sag was so so and this is being generous. The basmati rice that came with the shrimp sag lacked salt in its totality so it just tasted like white mush. The chicken biryani was generous and had three pieces of chicken which was enough. However, it was not tasty like the last time--again lacking in spices. Everything was freshly made that has to be said. The waitress gave us some raita (yogurt) and let us sample the \""sambar?\""when we inquired about what the buffet was like (before we got our food) It was lentils in a tomato base. Really good. \nThe waitress was very polite, attentive and just an overall nice young lady. \nI am so disappointed in the food this time around though. I know this cannot be the same chef who made our food the last time. The bad thing about the restaurant business is the movement of chefs and staff. Here today, gone tomorrow. Today was a case where the former chef was greatly missed by us. I don't think I would make another trip out to 24th Avenue and Bell to eat this indian food. I thought I had found a gem, but sadly this is not the case. \nManagement: Work on your food... who was cooking in December that made my first visit so great???",negative,en

Our annual conference this year was held at the Hilton San Francisco Union Square. Nothing too exciting to say about the rooms. I never felt like my room was completely clean as I would continue to find items on the floor. Things were not replenished and my ice bucket was never given a clean baggy each day. The room was nice but I only overlooked a roof. The health club was a good size and plenty of equipment to work out on. Finding conference rooms at times was difficult and confusing (this was a very large conference). There are plenty of places to walk to (would not do it at night by myself). If you need assistance you must ask for it. The food prices in the hotel are a little outrageous.

Here are some of the reasons Rudy Cools gets 5 stars:\n\n1. Michael and his team are all punctual and friendly. You get a specific appointment time, not a 4 hour window like so many other places offer. While they are working, they will chat with you about their kids, gardens, dogs, etc :)\n2. The staff is neat, clean and professional - they wear uniforms and don't arrive covered in mud and grime (other companies have done this and tracked dirt and grease all over my home).\n3. They are knowledgeable and helpful. They will take you outside and show you what is wrong (how it currently looks vs. how it should look). They spend time explaining the issue and the options to you and let you decide on the best course of action. I've never felt \""pushed\"" to do something and I understand why I'm spending my money on.\n4. The prices are completely fair, and the company offers financing too!\n5. They can service both residential and commercial units - this was not the case with other companies I had tried in the past.\n\nEvery single time I have interacted w/ Michael and his staff, I have been thoroughly impressed. It's great to see a business owner who is so skilled, hard working, and involved w/ his customers. Thanks guys!!!",positive,en

"We came to laugh, we stayed to rock.\nThursday night, no plans. So we decided to go to a comedy show in the Paris Casino. Intimate room to see a comedy show. Drinks are not cheap but we got our tickets for free, so we didn't mind paying the drink prices. The waitresses can be slow at times, but you can go up to the bar and get them if you don't want to wait.\nAs soon as the comedy show was over, they quickly set up the small stage with 2 pianos. And the music began, one piano man...and then the next. I've been to a piano bar before, but this one was so much better. They'll play anything that's been on the radio for the last 60 years. Just write it down and shoot them a few dollars. They played a great mix of music and performed them really well. We were sure to test their range with Led Zeppelin \""The Immigrant Song\"", Hanson's \""MMMBop\"" (LOL), CeeLo Green \""F*** You\"", and The Dead Milkmen \""Punk Rock Girl\"". We had so much fun we ended up staying for the whole 4 hours they perform. Behind the piano men are windows to the casino, it's fun to watch the people go by, looking confused as to whats going on inside, some passerbys actually licking or kissing the windows.\nI'm already getting my request list ready for next time.",neutral,en

"This is the fifth time we stayed in this hotel.
I love the hotel and the neighborhood.
It is a rather simple hotel (3.5 stars), the location is excellent in the upper west side.
The rooms are large for NY and all have kitchenettes. There are suites available with one or two bedrooms and a living room which is excellent for a family.
The prices are very reasonable for NY.
The hotel was renovated about three years ago (a little late in my opinion), and now has modern amenities and very nice, pleasant rooms.
Just across the street you have Fairway Market, Starbucks, Citarella gourmet, and a nice diner in the hotel building.
The subway is 2 min from the hotel.
As I said, I love the location and the hotel even though it is not a 4-5 stars hotel I usually stay at.",positive,en

No alcohol served, just good food by good people. Put it on your list, you won't regret it.",positive,en
"When we chose to stay here earlier this year we were hesitant given the remote location in the DFW area...however, based on the deal we found via TripAdvisor and the reviews we decided to give this hotel a shot...
I am a long term Marriott customer in part due to the excellent service and quality establishments that characterize the hotels that carry the Marriott name...
Upon arrival, we found that the hotel was as you would expect with a Residence Inn...however, during the stay there were a few issues that arose...
First, when we got to our room, we found used socks and a sword under our bed,not a toy sword, but a 2 foot long sword...needless to say we were a little concerned about the thoroughness of the room cleaning prior to our arrival....we took the items down to the front desk and got shoulder shrug response...
Second, the key to the room only worked intermittently...the front desk staff (after initially wondering whether this was because we had the card close to a cell phone or perhaps the issue was user error) came up and found the key to only work sporadically...we were told they would address the issue but never did during our 5 night stay...
The exercise room also functioned as a sauna...there was a typical air conditioner in the room (functioning at low efficiency) and no fan...my wife and I are both in good shape and we found it difficult to remain in the exercise room more than 30 minutes...
The pool is apparently open to the public...during the one afternoon we were at the pool with our kids, two different families drove up to the backside of the hotel (where the pool is located), unpacked their chairs, coolers, pool toys, etc and joined right in...these families were friendly and appropriate but significantly reduced the amount of room in the pool for hotel guests.
The quality of the food provided at breakfast was less than one would expect at a Residence Inn...at a Residence Inn one expects the food to be fresh with many options. This particular one struggled to keep the food fresh and the options were more limited than at other Residence Inns in which we have stayed...
Finally, there was a mix up in our reservations...long story short, we went through Expedia for this reservation...accidentally made two reservations instead of one....thought I had cancelled one of them (but admittedly, failed to click ""cancel"" on the cancellation page)...the fact I had two reservations in my name for 5+ days and yet only checked in for one of them was never brought up during my stay...after the stay was over, I found out about this error and brought the issue up with Expedia...they recognized the issue and called to see about getting something adjusted...the manager at this Residence Inn would not grant any adjustment (thus I was double charged for 5 nights)...I then turned to Marriott's rewards customer service...everyone within the rewards and regular Marriott customer service was very helpful, understood the situation, and one more than one occasion reached out to this hotel about an adjustment, to no avail. Finally,I spoke with Mr. Marriott's office directly, told them the whole situation and they handled the adjustment....
In the end, my appreciation and loyalty to the Marriott brand was increased by this experience. Everyone with Marriott was helpful, appreciative, and went out of their way to rectify this situation. However, I will not stay at this particular hotel ever again. The hotel itself warrants 3 stars, but the problems with addressing the reservation issue lowers it to 2 stars....",negative,en

But when one of them got off, he proceeded to go and make orders! He didnt even acknowledge me! As a matter of fact, neither of them acknowledged me. So I wait for another 5 minutes and still the same scenario. I left wondering what the heck were these guys doing? I know both of them saw me but did nothing. Def will be awhile before I even consider coming back if at all. That's too bad because I thought their food was really good.\n\nYelp 365 Review Challenge #142 \""Saddy's Pizza\""",negative,en

"This is a new concept for Hyatt and I only stay here when I cannot get into my favorite Grand Hyatt one block away. While it is a nice hotel and the rooms are fine it irritates me that they (management) just don't get it with recognition for the Diamond passport members. As a diamond member I always get free bottled water in the room or it is comped when asked. A simple bottle of water right? Oh no indicate the staff, it is $5 a bottle and we don't comp water for diamond members. There is a grocery store around the corner to buy bottled water. Humm..that is exactly what I want to do is go to my room then go out to get a bottle of water because the management doesn't get it and wants to charge its top frequent stayers $5 for a bottle of water.
Now they do give you a free breakfast coupon which is nice but I am not sure if that is a diamond benefit or a corporate negotiation on the rate.
Only one issue with the room which is very hotel W styled and that is the sound proofing on the room doors is terrible. Every knock at the door next to you or conversation in the hallway sounds as if your door is wide open. So I would recommend you get a room at the end of a hallway to cut down on traffic discussions and far away from the elevator. Try any floor room ending in 55, 54 or 56.",neutral,en

"I've been here 3 times for a Brazilian wax. The first time, with Allison, was my first experience getting a Brazilian (I've been having \""regular\"" bikini waxes for twenty plus years, so I know what they tend to feel like). Allison was quick & professional, if not terribly engaging. She did go over a few places more than once & that worried me. But, the results were great & lasted a long time, with no grow-out problems (I'd purchased their $20 small bottle of lotion that prevents in-grown hair). Second experience with another waxer (Allison had moved) was mediocre...hair grew out much quicker & I had some ingrown hair issues. Figuring it was just a \"" technique\"" difference,when I called for my third appointment, I carefully explained to the receptionist my concerns. She said...\""Oh, it's probably the (2nd) tech...I'll put you with someone who does the waxes like Allison did\"". Well...third time is definitely NOT \""the charm\"". She missed half the hair (where I couldn't see it!) and I've had lots of ingrowns, despite using the rather expensive lotion that UW recommends. Very unhappy with this and I won't be back. Sad, because the place is adorable and the staff friendly..in fact, I'd recommended it to several friends....before my lousy experiences.
