"Krung Siam used to be my go to place for Thai food: however, the last three times I have been to this place has been nothing but disappointing! What happened, I'm not sure but it feels like they change chef or something. I went there for lunch on MDW ordered Pat Se-ew, my favorite dish and they informed us there is no chow- phun noodles. WTH, really its 11:45am and you ran out of the noodles for your most popular dish? So then I proceed to order a beef salad, and it was the saltiest dish they could have made!. Everything was drench in salt, even my tomatoes were salty! My friend ordered pineapple fried rice and it was wet and clumpy. My boyfriend ordered a bowl of tomyum soup, and that was the only dish that tasted great. Maybe they have a different chef that works during lunch hour and one at night. When I came to Krung Siam in the past, it had always been at night, where the food tasted out of this world and the live music created such a nice ambiance.",negative,en

"BELL WITCH HAUNTING (aka THE HAUNT) is an American horror movie supposedly based on real events that took place during the period 1817 to 1821.This is not to be confused with BELL WITCH: THE MOVIE, a movie starring Betsy Palmer based on the same events. However, I can say that I wish I had seen this other movie instead of the one I saw! I enjoyed Betsy Palmer's chilling performance in Friday THE 13TH. As such, I believe that even on a bad day, she'd pull off a better performance than anyone involved in the travesty known as THE HAUNT.With regard to my heading, this movie is not painful to watch because the content is disturbing. It is painful to watch because it is just downright boring.Reading the positive reviews for this movie, I could only identify three possibilities. The first possibility - these authors were involved in the production in some way. The second possibility - the authors whilst not directly involved were paid to write positive reviews after production was completed. The final possibility - none of these authors has seen a sufficient number of horror movies and therefore is inexperienced with the concepts that successful attempts utilise.The setting for the plot is Robertson County, Tennessee. James Johnston receives a visit from two journalists eager to hear the story of the Bell Witch. The story is told as a series of flashbacks. A series of supernatural events begin happening at the home of John Bell and his family. It soon transpires that a vengeful spirit is behind it all.On the surface the plot appears to be a standard poltergeist affair, albeit one based on real events.Where execution of the brilliant concept is concerned however, just about everything that could go wrong does go wrong. And then some!First, the acting. The acting is almost uniformly terrible right across the board. This factor does the most damage to the production, undermining any possible credibility of belief or interest on the part of the viewer. The voice of the vengeful spirit sounds more like a teenage girl experiencing teenage angst rather than a powerful demonic force expressing malevolent intent. I almost laughed when I heard some of her lines. Unfortunately, this voice began to become very annoying very quickly! I may not have been alive in the 1800s, but I find it incredibly hard to believe that any young woman alive at that time would speak in the way that this ""ghost"" does!Second, the direction. The direction is haphazard and very uneven. Some scenes show promise but potential is squandered by the clearly inexperienced director. Nothing is done with the camera, with sound or with lighting to add intensity to the scenes intended to be scary. The atmosphere is equally flat. A vengeful spirit is supposedly behind supernatural occurrences. Yet the effects are so incredibly inept that no one who has seen a proper horror movie would buy into them. I'll give one example. In one scene, the spirit attacks someone. See the scene for yourself. It's almost funny - almost.Third, the script. Whilst it may be the case that the events shown are faithful to accounts of real occurrences, it cannot be denied that most scenes are incredibly flat and boring. Scenes as short as two minutes feel much longer thanks to the poor dialogue - dialogue that fails to add depth to the characters or story. This movie is far too reliant on conversations to advance the story. Whilst this style was also the case with British movies from the British horror heyday of the 1960s and 1970s, it cannot be denied that the dialogue exchanges were always interesting to watch in these more professional earlier works. Peter Cushing for example could read a telephone directory and still hold attention of the viewers. The same cannot be said of the actors in THE HAUNT.Finally, the humour. The ill-guided attempts at humour in this movie are excruciating. An obese boy is the butt of many jokes. One particularly awful scene sees the said boy going to the outside toilet. This scene should never have been included - but it is and complete with sound effects in case you fail to understand what he is doing!The only positive points about the movie are the location and the costumes. The decision to shoot the picture near the original location helped add some authenticity. The costumes were also well chosen.Overall, THE HAUNT is an appalling movie. It is not even in the ""so bad it's good"" league. It is instead just boring. I advise everyone to save their money and avoid this movie like the plague. Don't even bother seeing it for free!I have never seen the other movie about the Bell Witch. But it really couldn't be any worse than THE HAUNT. Could it? I'll give this other movie a chance if I can track it down.In the meantime, I would advise everyone on here to check out some proper horror movies about ghosts and haunting. THE LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE, THE CHANGELING, RINGU, THE GRUDGE (Japanese original) and ONE MISSED CALL (Japanese original) are good places to start.",negative,en

"I made the reservations then read all the negative reviews. I considered canceling and booking at another hotel after reading all the negative reviews but decided, what the heck...it will be part of the expeirience...besides there was no consistency in the reviews..some good, some bad. We arrived late and our room was waiting for us. The girl at the front desk was not friendly and did not go out of her way to make us feel at home. You can at least smile and say welcome to the hotel..say something. No bellman was available so you have to haul your own luggage. Not bad for me but I feel sorry for woman traveling together or alone struggling with their luggage. After hauling our own luggage we found an average room..very worn but clean. Pretty much as expected..remember I had read the reviews. The bed was actually comfortable...probably very well broken in...the song Burning Love just popped in my head. The ""deluxe continental breakfast"" is a joke. Stale bisquits, watered down gravy, stale pastries, worn out fruit...two bites and we we gone.
The rest of the trip was enjoyable,Graceland, lunch at the Crome Grill, Sun Studios (a must if you are in any way a music lover - not just an Elvis fan), the Stax Record tour, and the Rock and Roll Museum, BBQ'ed ribs on Beale Street.
Back to the hotel. All I kept thinking to myself was, this could be so much better...without a lot of work or expense. Come on owners/operators of the hotel. Read these reviews and be responsive to what your customers are saying. They are driving away a lot of business with these negative reviews. Hire helpful, friendly staff, spend a few $$$ and make the breakfast at least etible...it could be so much better!! Would I stay there again, probably not...heck the Day's Inn on the other side of Graceland looked better....or one of the hotels on Beale Street which seemed to be very nice. I must say I was disappointed with the hotel. Hopefully they will see the light and read the reviews and make an effort to fix things.",negative,en

"My boyfriend and I stayed and Palomar San Francisco last summer.
Overall it is a nice hotel. Our room had a lovely street view. The layout of the room was great, lounge and the restaurant very enjoyable. Unfortunately, I had to bring down my overall rating of our stay due to the “screaming” incident.
One night we decided to tuck in early and were peacefully asleep before I was woken up by a sound of someone trying to open the room door with a key. Assuming it is a confused guest who would try a couple of times and be on his way, I quietly waited for him to go away. Then to my surprise door opens and a guy with a trolley luggage enters the room.
As I was still half asleep, and as this chain of events was rather unexpected, I decided (probably not the most rational decision, I agree) that the best reaction is to start screaming. So I did. My boyfriend wakes up (of my screaming I am sure) and in sudden awakening shock started screaming as well. I heard his screams and feeling that screaming is now fully justified started screaming louder. At this point our midnight intruder, that just entered a dark hotel room that I am sure he assumed empty, and was greeted by screaming started screaming back. After few minutes of all three of us screaming, he apologized and left the room.
We laughed it off, and were ready to fall back asleep, when someone knocked on the door. It was a security manager, who told us that front desk checked someone else into our room by mistake.
Next morning we went to get some coffee from the lounge and upon return we discovered that our keys no longer open the room door. I went to the front desk and asked to fix the keys. Front desk lady reactivated the keys and commented: “Next time keep your keys away from the credit cards so they don’t deactivate”. “Solid advice” I said “However, this particular time, I believe the key problem is caused by Front desk checking in another guest into our room by mistake in the middle of the night last night”. “Weird” was the response.
“Weird” indeed. I kind of expected and apology…. But oh well….
I generally like Kimpton, because of the boutique feel and nice amenities, but since the incident I tried to stay away. I guess “Weird” was not a reaction from the hotel staff I was expecting in this situation.",neutral,en

"Добрый день. Хочу сказать спасибо всем работникам дополнительного офиса в посёлке Строитель (Тамбовская область). Являюсь вкладчиком с 13 .0 5. 2013 года. В офисе в посёлке Строитель мне очень нравится индивидуальный подход к каждому клиенту. 0 2. 0 3. 2022 года сотрудник банка позвонил мне и рассказал о возможности переоформить мой действующий вклад Пенсионный плюс с 7.5 под 20 годовых(здесь я почувствовала настоящую заботу о себе, как о клиенте банка) и также предложили оформить вклад Пенсионный плюс под 12 годовых на год. Объяснив, это предложение тем что через 3 месяца 20 закончится я смогу переложить свои денежные средства под хороший процент. Так и получилось 2. 0 6 .2022 года закончился у меня вклад Доходный пенсионный и я снова поспешила в офис. Действительно совместно с сотрудником банка переложила мои средства под очень хороший процент (12 , 5 ).Такого процента уже не было ни в одном банке. Денежные средства мы копили с супругом на осуществление своей мечты Покупку нового автомобиля , но никак не могли подобрать нужный вариант для пенсионеров. 20. 11.2022 года мы подобрали вариант транспортного средства, которое нас устроило. Хотели оплатить в автосалоне картой, которую мы оформили в Россельхозбанке 14 .0 2 .2022 года и перевести денежные средства через мобильное приложение с вклада на карту( как нас научили в банке), но услышали, что мы должны будем оплатить автосалону комиссию в размере 1 ,8 . Для нас пенсионеров сумма очень значительная,так как для нас пенсия с супругом является единственным источником дохода. Мы сначала с супругом расстроились, но потом решили что пойдём в банк, где хранятся наши накопления и обратимся к сотрудникам, которые всегда помогали решать все возникающие наши проблемы. Так действительно и получилось. Пришли в офис сняли с вклада без проблем необходимую сумму через кассу без комиссии и поехали в салон, где осуществили свою мечту Покупку нового автомобиля .Банком, полностью довольны, надеемся, что сотрудничество будет и дальше продолжаться также позитивно, как и сейчас.

"CyberTracker is set in Los Angeles sometime in the near future where bodyguard Eric Phillips (co-producer Don 'The Dragon' Wilson) saves senator Robert Dilly (John Aprea) from an assassination attempt by a group known as the UHR, the Union of Human Rights, who are angry at Dilly for spearheading the Computerised Judicial System in which robots called CyberTrackers are sent out to determine & dispense justice on the guilty. Anyway, Eric saves Dilly who is very impressed & decides to see if he can trust Eric in his shady activities like the cold blooded murder of a traitor, being the fine upstanding guy that he is Eric isn't impressed when Dilly kills a woman & he is asked to keep it quiet. Eric escapes & sets out to bring Dilly down, however Dilly has lots of powerful friends & he uses his influence to frame Eric & have his CyberTrackers sent out in pursuit of him...Co-produced & directed by Richard Pepin I think films like CyberTracker give films a bad name, I didn't like it that much at all. The script by Jacobsen Hart is pretty predictable, it doesn't excite, it steals most of it's ideas & theme from other better sci-fi films & the heady mix of martial arts action & sci-fi don't gel that well. There a few fights, some car chases & a couple of shoot outs but it's all rather bland & forgettable. The film lacks imagination considering the film is set in the future & it deals with robots, technology & the way society is run & it's judicial system in particular. Speaking of which the fantastic Robocop (1987) mixed it's violent action & clever social commentary brilliantly but CyberTracker doesn't even try to make any relevant social statement or try to portray any meaningful moral message about law enforcement, the script basically uses the concept to have robots & shoot outs which Robocop did as well but also managed to include a good story. There is very little in CyberTracker that I can say was entertaining & that's what films are about right?Director Pepin does OK but nothing stands out, it's all rather forgettable & it's not particularly exciting. The sci-fi elements are nothing more than the robot side of things & as a whole the film doesn't look that futuristic. The action scenes are alright, there's some exploding cars & some shoot outs but nothing spectacular.Technically CyberTracker is average, for a film supposedly set in the future it already looks dated & the special effects are poor. The acting was bad, I wonder if Don 'The Dragon' Wilson signs cheques with that name?CyberTracker was a waste of my time, there is nothing here original or exciting & the action is instantly forgettable. Poor & that's all that needs to be said, not recommended.",negative,en

"Наступили выходные, как всегда ждём от выходных, незабываемые впечатления. Выездной пикник, самое главное блюдо, как всегда шашлык. Хочеться найти самый вкусный, и по дороге остановились взять не в большом супермаркете, а в фирменном магазине Скопинский, что находится в Дядьково Рязанской области. Купили Шашлык Фирменный 2 кг по 419 р. за кг. Не дешёвое мясо, но за качество надо платить или ехать в Европу за 249 р. покупать. Кусочки свинины на вид выглядили аппетитно, не смотря на прожилки большие свисающие, которые можно было отрезать. Цвет у готового шашлыка был красивый, позвали, как всегда в первую очередь детей пока горячий за стол. Но больше одного куска никто не съел, толи они не проголодались, то ли не хочеться в жаркую погоду, но больше всех кричали, что хотели есть. пришла пора взрослых кушать, как не странно, нам тоже не хотелось его есть но причина была очевидна Мясо старое, оно было такое жёсткое, соус не смог его размягчить, такое не вкусное. Это был крах, ехали покушать шашлыка, хоть мимо бегущие собаки остались довольные. Как вернуть деньги, кто подскажет, если чек не сохранил. А так нога моя там не будет.",negative,ru

"I stayed at the Omni Berkshire in April this year, prior to boarding the Queen Mary 2 on it's transatlantic crossing to the UK.
I chose the Omni Berkshire because of the reviews on this website, but in truth I felt more than a little let down. It seemed as though they were 'coasting' on their reputation, and didn't seem at all keen to make sure that guests actually had a good experience.
I had 3 rooms booked for our party of 7. One of the rooms wasn't ready on arrival, and the staff were downright unhelpful even an hour later when it still wasn't ready, despite promises to the contrary.
For our room, we had specified at booking that we needed 2 beds, as we had our small daughter with us. It took 3 requests to finally get a camp bed to the room, and it was so uncomfortable that I'm amazed she slept at all.
Throughout the night I struggled to find the source of a persistant beeping, eventually finding that it was a fax machine tucked away in a cupboard. Very useful, I'm sure, if you're a business traveller, but as a tourist with jetlag I was less than amused.
I will say that the baggage clerks were very good, and the concierge was very helpful, but they were very let down by the rest of the hotel staff. The hotel is very well located near to Central Park, which was lovely, but I wouldn't stay there again. I had spent an awful lot of money on 3 delux rooms - I expected better service for my money.",negative,en
"We knew this was an apartment-type place, but had no idea how strange this stay would be. When my boss arrived at 10:30pm, there was a note on the door to call for service. Someone came down the sidewalk in sweats and flip-flops and unlocked the door and gave him the key, telling him his room was down in the basement. Someone was already in that room, so my boss looked at the key and went upstairs to find his actual room...four flights up with no elevator. At one AM he was awakened when the room's door burst open and a man was standing there. He turned and left, but my boss didn't get much more sleep that night! Needless to say, he took his luggage with him that morning and I had to call to report the incident and cancel his next night's stay. They were kind enough to not charge him for that night's stay when they FINALLY discovered that another guest had indeed received the same room key as he did. But I would NOT recommend this hotel for a couple reasons...1) no 24 hour attendant/front desk if there are issues, 2) there are actually FOUR properties...we're lucky he was able to stay in the main property instead of getting shipped down the street a few blocks. If you know what you're getting into, I'm sure it's a quaint place to stay, but what a terrible surprise we had at Copley House!",negative,en

"PM Check-in was a positive - staff very pleasant. Our room was on 5th floor and far enough from elevator to help keep hall noise down.
We were traveling with 2 dogs - a first for us here. We rearranged arm chair to place rugs for 2 dog crates - the trim along floor was filthy. When we started to retrieve ice bucket - it was full of water - another sure sign of improper cleaning.
We bring rugs, towels from home to keep our dogs tracks to a minimum. I clean up after my dogs are aired and at this hotel I carried extra poop-bags and cleaned up after irresponsible pet owners. Our trips out doors had to be changed almost every trip - broken beer bottles, trash all over parking lot, female sanitary products on the ground. I observed a ""lady"" scraping the bags of trash from her SUV directly on to the parking lot, then just walking away. One trip up the elevator was quite a surprise - a young man (pre-teen) poured his drink onto the floor of elevation - his mom said nothing, just exited and walked away with out a word. We notified staffnon our exit floor of the mess left by the kid. There were kids running the halls at all hours and one morning the dried decor located on the table at the elevator was strewn all down the hall.
I bring all this up to state that my dogs are very well behaved - well cared for, well mannered, and were petted by many, many people (little ones to big ones). And we had a $150. Extra pet charge.....after what we experienced - I think those charges should be applied to the kid in the elevator and the lady dumping her trash in the parking lot. We are priority club members and have been for years - please consider the event we werenin town for andnhow much business we brought to this hotel - even had our banquet there this year.",negative,en

"The focus of the key relationship in a young man's life, that of his relationship with his father, was excellently portrayed in this movie, ""The Greatest Game Ever Played."" The movie captured the essence of how important it is for a father to validate his son and let him know that he has what it takes to follow his dream.It didn't matter that economic and social class mores presented obstacles to be overcome by both father and son. It also didn't matter that others were acclaiming the son in exuberant celebration. What mattered the most was that he saw his father's hand and then his face of approval. The real life challenge for both father and son had been met.Considering that in real life the hero of the story kept his amateur status and became a businessman pretty much verifies that all that went before the match was the training ground for a valid father and son relationship.",positive,en
"It's not often I give two stars to a horror movie because horror is my favorite genre. A movie can be BAD in that it isn't a masterpiece but can be enjoyable on the basis of unintentional humour, bizarre characters, etc. A case in point are a great number of horror/sci-fiction movies from the 1940s to 1980s era. They are enjoyable for genre-buffs and guilty-pleasure seekers because their ""badness"" is entertaining. However, this movie has none of the humour or effective gory scenes of the ""Piranha"" (1978) original. I suppose in 1995 it was the heyday of political correctness so gore on TV was at a minimum. Now in the mid-2000s with the C.S.I. shows, TV's an absolute blood-fest! (Good for us horror fans!)William Katt and Alexandra Paul are no Bradford Dillman and Heather Menzies (the original 1978 stars.) It's not Katt's and Paul's faults but the writers and director who created this tepid turkey. How the main characters interact is the main flaw of this movie. I won't say how because that is part of the plot. This TV movie probably had a bigger budget than the original but flopped as good horror, as can be seen from the user votes here. Stick with the 1978 original if you're in the mood for a killer-fish movie!",negative,en

"Went with my son's to check out the place. Had been there when it was Pure Taco. Inside is nice. \nThe +'s ... The pulled pork was moist and had a good flavor, not the best ever, but good. The sauces were tasty, but not traditional NC vinegar based. The sides were ok. The Mac and cheese were good, the beans were better. Overall, I would give the food 4 stars.\n\nThe -'s ... Portion size and price. You can tell it's a franchise when the food comes. Not your typical BBQ joint large tray. The pork was about as much as you would get in a good sandwich and the sides came in small cups like some places use for ketchup, well a little bigger maybe. For $10 and change, not a lot of food.

"The Standard Downtown is a decent hotel but they try way too hard to be cool, sexy, and edgy. It's too much. We stayed there since we were seeing Ricky Gervais at the Nokia Theater, and we got a good deal on the room on Jetsetter.com.
We stayed in the HUGE Room. It's cool to look at but doesn't offer much functionality. My husband didn't like that the bed was on the floor and the bathroom was awkwardly layed out. It was a bit too modern and ended up feeling very cold. It also wasn't very clean. There was hair in the shower, and I'm pretty sure there was blood on some of the bathroom walls
We were on the 12th floor right across from the elevator which sucked, b/c all night you heard the elevator ding and drunk people go back and forth from the roof top. We checked out the Roof Top ""Club/Lounge"" and it's sort of a joke. It was great that you didn't have to buy a bottle to sit down, but there seemed to be no dress code and they were telling people that there was a 30 minute wait. However, when we got up there, (you don't have to wait in line if you're staying at the hotel) there was hardly anyone up there. I might be bias since I'm from Vegas, but I wasn't impressed at all. San Diego's roof tops are much better.
The staff was friendly and helpful though. Jessica was able to check us in at 11:30 am, since our flight got in at 7:00 am.

"The most incompetent airline you could fly with. They lost my luggage in the hold and two stopover flights when I returned to my country were delayed to the point that I lost the third. My vacation thanks to them was a nightmare, because I lost a lot of things thanks to their ineptitude, in addition to buying clothes, hygiene items, among other things. I lost count of the times I called to find out about the whereabouts of my suitcase. I even had to wait more than three months for them to pay me what was lost. The icing on the cake was that what they gave me covers only half of the total value of what my suitcase had. I advise you that although their prices are tempting, do not travel with this airline.

The cheese-crisp is huge with generous amount of cheese. I ask for tomatoes on top.. I like their tostadas and crispy tacos.. I try to get a Mango rum Pina Colada which goes well with Mexican food. As for the tortillas tasting store bought, thats news to me.. I think these are far better for restaurant made than most restaurants like Chevy's who makes theirs in plain sight!\n\nIf you like the chains of mexican food, Garcias, etc.. give this place a shot, you'll like it!!",neutral,en

"To wake up just to have breakfast is not my style. To drive downtown is not my style either. To pay for parking??? Heck no!!! I'd much rather have an apple and sit in front of the TV or drive to work. I must have been possessed when I decided to come to eat. There was construction going on too. It's a small place so I can imagine the line later during the day or weekend.\n\nI ordered a truffled egg sandwich. My friend wanted eggs benedict but they only serve it during the weekend so she opted for the Mediterranean egg white frittata.\n\nTruffled Egg Sandwich:\nScrambled eggs with mushrooms, feta cheese, 2 strips of bacon and chives with a side of smashed potatoes. The bread was crispy...I would normally skip half of the bread but it was good that I had to eat the whole thing. The saltiness from the bacon, the creamy mild tartness from the feta, the earthiness of the mushrooms and chives with fluffy scrambled eggs...I. could. not. stop. eating. 5/5\n\nMediterranean Egg White Frittata:\nI normally prefer egg whites and have nothing to do with egg yolks. This is my idea of a perfect breakfast minus the olives since I'm allergic to them. It has spinach, tomato, sprouts, feta cheese with an English muffin. My friend was lucky it had olives, otherwise, I would have been all over this too. 5/5\n\nThe service was great. The chef/owner was there. Each breakfast plate is about $11. My advice is to bring coins for the parking meter.\n\nTo enjoy good food is my style.",positive,en

"I rarely make these comments but I felt compelled to spare others the pain I endured in watching this movie. It's so stupid and implausible both in the overall story and in the details that you simply can't suspend disbelief. The problem starts early, when you see a government researcher tooling around in a new Porsche and dining with his team in a restaraunt that looks like a castle, overlooking the Capitol Building in Washington, D.C. That kind of life on a government salary? Hah! It only gets worse. Toward the end, when the bad guy starts killing off the good guys, the latter group act so stupidly that you want them to die, in order to cleanse the gene pool. The special effects are pretty good - any producer's money can buy that - and the lead actors have been great in other films, but the screenplay and direction here are moronic. Many people have wondered whether there was some deliberate intelligence behind Paul Verhoeven's previous, facially stupid movies (Showgirls, Starship Troopers), but this movie should stop the wondering.

"Probably the best Chinese buffet in the Charlotte area, but that's not saying much. This place is almost always packed, so expect a long wait - more than an hour at peak times.\n\nVery large restaurant with a lot of seating, look out for the hidden stairs that seem to be everywhere. I'm not sure why they decided to add that little complication, but they did. Really handy when you're carrying a plate of food and a bowl of soup.\n\nSushi, always my first stop, was fresh. One area of rolls and another of fish, it was being made right there and there was plenty of it. Eel, salmon, tuna, plus sashimi in some sort of sauce. Not a very wide variety, I'm afraid. The holder with hand rolls only had one eel the whole time I was there.\n\nThere's a soup bar (I think that's what it was) where you can have the chef add your stuff to it and he cooks it up right there. There's also a grill nearby which is turning out fresh dumplings and grilled tofu and some other stuff.\n\nThe steam tables were always stocked and not just with the Americanized Chinese food. There were quite a few more authentic options, including some strange looking cuts of beef and chicken that I've not seen elsewhere in Charlotte. And the usual Pork Lo Mein, Fried Rice, and the Crawfish that everyone seems to like (though I don't!). Of course, french fries and fried potatoes and cheese sticks and even tacos!\n\nLots of wait staff, so drinks are always refilled and dirty plates are picked up quickly.\n\nWould I come here again? Maybe on the weekend when I am willing to wait. The non-crab legs hours seem to be a lot less expensive.",neutral,en
"Another Asian themed buffet in Vegas...doesn't hurt if the food is alright to pretty good. This Sahara location is conveniently located on the West Side of Las Vegas, just off South Summerlin on the hustle and bustle along the Sahara Strip of business galore. If any of you have been to Buffet@Asia...you are pretty much getting the same perks if not better. The atmosphere from the outside appearance is clean and fresh. Once you get in through the doors, the array of food welcomes you. It has been strategically well planned as far as layout goes. Spacious in both seating and food arrangements. The place is surrounded by windows gathering natural light and makes it more welcoming than Buffet@Asia (if any of you have been there you will know what I mean) \n\nPrice wise...it is a little cheaper than Buffet@Asia, but almost the same in price. This is not your Todai or Makino's gourmet Asian Buffet, but you will have plenty of selection to choose which will be enough to satisfy the cravings. I myself am a fan...who wouldn't mind going here every now and then. If you are in the area...check it out. It's more of a hit then a miss. \n\nDon't forget to try their Mochi Balls (sesame) they are a great snack/dessert. Nice and warm, light with a bit of sweetness. Pretty good than most places. :)",neutral,en

"YUM!!! My friend and I stopped in for lunch because this looked like a comfortable place, and each of us was leaving from separate terminals, so it was convenient being right in the middle. Delicious food at reasonable prices, whether or not it's an airport restaurant. My friend had an onion soup, which surprised her with a kick from red pepper flakes. I enjoyed a delicious bowl of chicken tortilla soup and although it needed a pinch of salt, it was a great consistency and very good with fresh avocado chunks on top. We shared an appetizer of some mouth-watering deviled eggs with bacon sprinkled on top... comfort food to the max! The restaurant is lovely and very cozy; the service is very good; and the prices are a good value for airport dining. If this restaurant had a location in Sacramento, I'd be a regular!\n\nNOTE: If you don't want to sit down and dine, the restaurant has a take-away counter located to the right of their restaurant entrance. Not sure whether they sell a limited or full menu, but I'd bet it's a great option if you're short on time and want something to munch on that's satisfying to the palate.",positive,en

"This was a nice little find off the strip. We came for the lunch buffet which was $10.99/person. \n\nBUFFET ITEMS:Vegetable korma, yellow daal, chana masala, vegetable samosa, sweet rice, basmati rice, vegetable pakora, chicken tandoori, chili chicken, chicken makhani, chicken curry, goat curry and the BEST part was that they had my favorite GULAB JAMUN!! \n\nThe chicken curry was very flavorful, it had a great balance of creaminess and spices. It also contained big chunks of chicken which is what most people tend to skimp on (abundance of protein is always a plus in a buffet dish). I was surprised that they had goat curry (gamey stuff is not my cup of tea so this one I did not try). The gulab jamun were little balls of perfection. \n\nSERVICE: our server was very attentive and quick to refill our glass of water.\n\nI subtracted a star b/c although the gulab was legit, they only had the gulab and rice pudding for dessert. There was no mango pudding or the carrot halwa the sweet carrot dessert, but I guess you can't have everything. I also wasn't a fan of their naan that they offered.

The restaurant is tiny, but they can turn tables relatively quickly, and the food is fabulous! The cinnamon roll is to die for! It would be a meal in and of itself for one person. We split it among 3 people which let us share in the deliciousness, but not spoil our appetites as there was much more food to come. I got the ham and cheese scramble, which came with home fries, and I was able to eat almost half of it. Even as leftovers one day later, it was still excellent.

"I was at the Penn for 4 nights with an educational party from 19 - 23 November - there were around 35 of us in total. Was not looking forward to the hotel stay as had read the reviews and knew what to expect (which actually helped a lot - I had imagined it eve worse than it is).
Starting with the good:
Excellent location - can't fault it for accessibility. Check in was fast. New carpets in the hallways (certainly on floors 2 and 14 anyway). New carpet in our room on the 2nd floor, powerful, hot shower, clean bed linen and towels changed daily, no musty smell, no evidence of roaches or mice and no bed bugs. Fantastic view of Empire State Building (and Chrysler) from our room on 14th floor. Most of the bell hops are truly miserable, but if you can find Frank the bellhop he is a wonderful guy - cheerful and helpful and recommended so many good restaurants and places to go and marked them all on a map for us - if only there were more Franks around.
The bad:
Dim lighting (although this is fairly common in hotels). The bath you would not want to use (in our 2nd floor room) - not dirty but rusty and was OK to put your feet into while having a shower but wouldn't want to lie in it. Incredibly noisy. 2nd floor is so close to the busy street that never stops and there is no double glazing so the noise is incredible. We had ear plugs with us which I would adivse for anyone staying there. Our room on the 14th floor (I'll get to why we had to switch rooms) had filthy carpets which you would not want to put bare feet on (we had slippers) and the plaster was coming away at various points due to damp I would imagine and it did smell musty. The corridoors on the 14th floor were particularly damaged and had crumbling plaster.
The ugly:
We had 2 connecting doors in our room on the 2nd floor (not to other members of our party). On the first night we were woken at 3am by a man coming back into one of the connecting rooms who was speaking loudly into a mobile phone I presume - but he sounded as if he was in the room with us. OK, I can put up with this, everyone is entitled to make a little noise. However, 2nd night we are woken up at the same time, only this time the guy next door has other males with him (I would say 3 in all) who try to break down the interconnecting door - they weren't just ""testing"" it, there were trying to get in and were shouting too. Quite frightening for two women on their own, half a mile down a coridoor from the elevators. Foolishly perhaps, we didn't do anything (should have called security I know - but to be honest we didn't want to make a noise as I didn't want to confirm that we were women on our own and I wasn't confident that security would come to our aid anyway). Next morning we went to the front desk to ask someone to speak with the people in this room and tell them that if it happened again we would dial 911 immediately. Front desk sent us to security. Security guy spoke with us, didn't take us that seriously (didn't even stand up while talking to us, so rude) told us we should have called security at the time and there was nothing he could do now, and that we shouldn't worry as it is impossible to get into a connecting door from the other room if you have locked your side (fortunately I had checked it when we first got the room and had locked it as it was open). As he could see we were distressed, he did say that he would speak with the deputy duty manager to see if we could move room. Spoke with the ddm, who did not once apologise for what had happened. He gave us the room on the 14th floor and said he thought it didn't have a connecting door. Well, it did, and the room was in so much more dis-repair than the 2nd floor one, but as it was a much quieter room and had a view to die for, and we knew we just wouldn't feel safe back in our old room, we moved. Two other members of our party had to move rooms too - but this was due to mice. No one saw any roaches and no one had any bed bugs.
Did it spoil my trip to New York? No way, New York is a truly wonderful city and we had a blast. The galleries and museums (we are an art and design class) are absolutely top rate and we could have spent months looking round them. We had some great experiences and I can't wait to go back with my husband - but we will stay at another hotel if at all possible. If you are booked into the Penn, go prepared. Knowing what to expect helps a lot and it is then bearable. How do they get away with it? I guess it must be the location and the prices.

This is my neighborhood Fry's and usually my grocery store of choice. I think that the layout of the store is good and easy to shop. The produce selection is good and they have a fair amount of organic options. I also like the selection of natural products that this location has. This location also has a Fry's gas station right out front which saves you some money at the pump if you have enough rewards on your Fry's card. I usually feel like I get a pretty good deal here. Associates have also always been eager to help if I need to find something. The check out experience has always been good.\n\nOne of the reasons for the three star review is because the bathrooms at this location are disgusting. I have informed a manager on one of my visits of the horrible condition that the bathrooms are in and she did seem to take action right away as far as sending someone to clean them. The store does seem a little bit aged which is odd because I think that it is fairly new. I would recommend going to the restroom before going shopping at this location.,negative,en

"Sadly, I traveled to El Paso due to a death in the family. My stay at this hotel lasted 5 nights. Number one problem was half of the outlets were inoperative. No big deal, just found others that worked, or did without. Second, the hair dryer wouldn't turn on. Not a big deal either, but who wants to have to purchase a hair dryer after you specifically check for that detail on their web page. When asked if there was anyway we could get a couple of extra towels, we were told we would have to hunt down a maid and ask her. The next day the maid came to clean room, we were not ready to leave quite yet and asked her if she could wait and clean it later, after we were gone. Upon return to the hotel at 4pm I informed the front desk that our room had not received service yet and could they send housekeeping. I was told that staff had already left. She asked our room #, then told us the maid had informed her that we had left a do not disturb sign on the door. Umm, nope, we actually spoke to the maid. Next morning we asked for clean towels since there were none left the day before, we were told we had to wait as all of their towels were in the clothes dryer and they had no extras. I don't expect to be waited on,honestly, just the basics anyone would expect from a hotel. Very disappointed with the service at this hotel and will not stay here on my next trip. Almost forgot, my bedspread had several nasty stains... not very appealing :(",negative,en

- Sách ghi là kèm 2 CDs nhưng mình nhận được chỉ 1 CD thôi. Mà CD đấy lại đủ 55 tracks. Vậy ghi luôn là 1 CD cho con dân đỡ hụt hẫng thì hơn :)))

"Stayed at the hotel over a weekend in early April 2011. I had last visited in November 2008 and returned to quite a different experience.
Pros
- room was ready in advance of standard 4:00 check-in. Arrived at 3:00 and a room was ready
- location is very convenient to Times Square. This is both a pro (for tourists) and a con (for the rest of us who avoid Times Square like the plague)
- room rate was quite a deal for NYC in the spring (thank you, Travelzoo)
- despite being a block from the world's busiest intersection, the hotel has a quiet, tranquil feel. No problems sleeping
Cons
- the hotel, specifically the lobby and rooms, is showing its age. It ""feels"" a bit dirty - dust in the corners, aging furniture with stains and tears. If you've stayed in the past, you'll likely notice this more
- hotel staff is indifferent at best. Very few smiles or greetings and the staff seemed to take no interest in my request for a room upgrade if available due to the special nature of my visit
- location is very convenient to times Square. Again, a pro and a con. You will pay more for everything, especially food, and everyone knows the real good stuf fin NYC is south of 23rd St.

"The Gaslamp is one of my favorite places for a quick weekend getaway and this hotel puts you in the perfect place to take it all in. We had no problem with noise from the guests or the rail. The room was small and the bathroom was tiny but both were modern and nicely decorated. The bed was comfy and the lighting was adequate.
Now, on to why I only gave this place a 3 rating. Check In was easy but we were not supplied with any information on the hotel. The room was also sans information about on site dining or amenities. Just a couple of cute pairs of earplugs in case the train was too loud. We never did find the gym or pool. I am easy to give a little but there were a myriad of little things that added up. There was some porcelain damage to the tub that could have easily been fixed but was left ugly and staring at me when I took a shower. There were a few places in the shower that had black mold between the tiles. Again, another easy fix that was overlooked. The room and bathroom seemed fairly clean but the shower had black hair on the walls left behind from a previous guest. Ewww, The door to the bathroom had a broken closer at the top that just hung out dirty, rusted and useless. I'm not quite sure why it was there in the first place because even without it, the door would only stay in the closed position. Parking has gone up to $40 and for the money, I thought that the attendants were a little rude.(for $40 bucks you can open and close the door for me)

"Nice indoor range with fairly competitive range prices. At 15 dollars for range fee it's 5 dollars cheaper than most places around the strip. They offer discounts to locals and ladies on different days of the week. Targets are a dollar each and ammo is pricey. I'd bring in my own ammo or stop by walmart and grab targets and ammo before coming here. Also bring your own ear plugs and eye protection since buying your own will be cheaper in the long run than renting. Although hearing and eye protection are only a dollar each.\n\nThe range itself is clean and offers a pistol and rifle range. If you are debating on purchasing a firearm they also offer rentals so you may test it out before purchasing. Rifle range goes to a max of 50 yards. Pistol range goes up to 25 yards. \n\nFor tourists or those having an itchy trigger finger they offer shooting packages and opportunities to shoot machine guns. Definitely will have a good time here!\n\nHowever the store and gear they sell is pretty pricey. You'll be well off buying online and transferring to an ffl of your choice. They're transfer fees are pricey as well.\n\nStaff is very friendly and approachable. This place is definitely my favorite indoor range. They also have weekly deals for locals to get half off on Tuesdays and ladies shoot free on Wednesdays. Memberships are available, at $435 a year or maybe you'll get lucky and score a 1 year membership for $100 during one of their epic sales!!! 4 stars, great service",neutral,en

"So disappointed in the staff at Time Warner Arena - not sure if they are employed by arena or Checkers but someone needs to instill manners and customer service in them pronto. First, everyone that attends a hockey game knows that while the game is in progress and the puck is flying, you can not return to your seat. However, we were not allowed to our seats during player introduction and the playing of the national anthem. What is with that? They kept the entire area draped off and then allowed us to move forward 2 feet. Then play started and we were held up again for at least another 10 min. One patron asked why he was not allowed to his seat prior to the start of the game as many of us were asking. The \""staff\"" person barked he could have this patron removed if he didn't like it. It was Very uncomfortable to say the least. Once we finally got to our seats half of the first period was over.\n\nDuring one of the breaks the Shriners had a video showing the work they do which is admirable. However, the video was extremely graphic of a poor child who suffered burns to his face. It was worse that an horror movie I have ever seen. My complaint is that 60% of the people attending the hockey game were under 10 years old. This was not in good taste. This video should only be shown to adults and only then with a disclaimer. Poor judgment. \n\nUntil the Checkers are more appreciative of their fans, I will not return. My disposable dollars will be spent on other venues.",negative,en

"Truly disappointing on several levels. The quality of the fish was simply not that good. I'm not even comparing it to Sugarfish (highly recommended), but merely to local LA places like Brothers Sushi in Woodland HIlls. When I'm paying Nobu prices, I expect better than Woodland Hills sushi, know what I mean?\n\nThe portion sizes were, frankly, skimpy. I will credit them for serving a real Salmon Roll, whereas many sushi places use pieces of meat that has been broiled/burnt, this was real salmon skin, just like the good places do it.\n\nThe prices are really astronomical...and given that they all buy their fish from the same place(s), pretty ridiculous. Hey, I've had sushi in Japan with businesses, and even paid for it one time -- a vertiginous buying experience that will affirm to you that Amex truly does have no credit limit on your card -- so I do know good and even great sushi. This is not it.\n\nThe service was, and I'm not sure if this makes sense, but obsessively and (worse) aggressively obsequious. This guy would continually hover over us explaining to us how (and exactly) whatever we wanted would be taken care of by him of the sushi chef. Very intrusive, and I realize now it was the exact opposite of the very non-intrusive servile style found in sushi places world wide.",negative,en

"Du gore pour faire du gore, voilà en quoi se résume ce film de Ridley Scott. Attendez, Ridley Scott ? on parle bien du réalisateur d'Alien, de Blade Runner, de Gladiator ? Et bien, est-ce que c'est la vieillesse qui lui fait perdre son talent ? Plus sérieusement, Hannibal est sans doute le plus mauvais film de Scott. Un scénario bourré d'incohérences, une intrigue qui n'a pas réussi à m'accrocher, un casting mauvais excepté Anthony Hopkins qui est le seul acteur à faire tenir ce film, et encore. Julianne Moore est sans doute une des pires actrices que j'ai pu voir, elle n'a aucun charme, aucune émotion sur son visage, rien, absolument rien, elle joue un rôle capital dans le film et c'est sans aucun doute elle qui fait perdre tout crédibilité- non mais sérieux, la scène où elle se réveille et qu'elle apprend qu'Hannibal est passée chez elle, elle est censée avoir peur non ? J'sais pas, c'est pas comme si un cannibale était entré par effraction dans sa propre maison pendant qu'elle dormait ? -Le personnage de Mason verger est intéressant mais est au final réduit à néant et n'est en aucun cas signifiant dans le film ce qui est vraiment dommage. Le personnage du membre du FBI est le personnage qui m'empêche de mettre la note la plus basse au film, car l'intrigue venant de lui est plutôt prenante, dommage qu'elle ne dure pas longtemps. Quant aux dialogues ils ne valent pas grand-chose. Enfin bref, Hannibal est une suite du grand Silence des Agneaux mais est très très loin de lui arriver à la cheville.

"This hotel is not within walking distance of ANYTHING... unless you like to walk 1/2 mile each way. There is no restaurant on site. The pool is outside (which I like) and is shared with other hotels (which I do not!). This is part of a cluster of hotels. \nWhen I arrived I was given a bottle of water, chocolates, and offered a rewards card! BTW, the rewards card only gets points if you book directly (no Expedia, etc.) so I probably won't use it. The room (they only have suites) was very nice! 2 beds (a waste for just me), a sitting area, separate wet bar area (no alcohol), separate sink area from bath, and a walk in closet. The room is large!\nThe TV is the satellite TV found in many hotels and I have never liked this! Movies are 4.99-14.99, which is exorbitant. The most annoying is that there is no TV guide channel. This happens too often! People travelling may not know the local schedules and, using satellite, makes researching schedules near impossible! Finally, there are no vending machines (the machines next to the ice machines were removed) so refreshments must be bought at the front desk. While the selection was wider this way, the wait to purchase and price were increased. Lastly, the exercise room is 24 hours! That is a rare but appreciated offering.\nImprovements: make a few smaller rooms (4-6 per floor) to make more money and save space, connect with a developer for a restaurant and service station, offer HDMI cord rental so patrons can use their phone to stream to the TV, offer a TV guide or offer a website with local programming (better yet, use cable), if you are going to provide a wet bar there should be an alcohol mini bar, insert vending machines in addition to the front desk offerings. Also, DO NOT share pools! Space is competitive enough at 1 hotel.",negative,en

I bought this outfit for the top. I love the print and didn't realize all the different colors in it until I got it. The material is nice and soft as well as great quality. I had read the reviews before purchasing so I knew what to expect with the jeans. They were very long and my daughter is very long (she is right months and has been wearing 9 month pants since 6 months). It is disappointing there isn't any backing on the torn parts because the second you try to get a wiggly baby's leg through, the toes puncture those areas and they tear easily. My daughter is in between 6 and 9 month tops and it was a little big but still worked (the arms were a little long and there was some room in the neck).",positive,en

"You bet your ass I gave this place five stars! Whoo hoo! \""QOQ\"" will be the main focus of this review. You know, quality over quantity or vice versa? Well, this place can go either way. All-You-Can-Eat Sushi for $24.95 along with $2 Sake Bombs, ALLLLLL DAYYYYY, sounds like a win-win situation in my case! \n\nA few warnings before we get down to the nitty gritty part of my review:\n-A 90 minute time limit to the AYCE goodness (NOOOOOO!)\n-A surcharge for wasting food\n-Only one order of Uni and Sweet Shrimp per person\n\nSo, the food: \n- The Uni: My first time having it, but I'm sure they did it right because the sweetness of the Sea Urchin and the gooey goodness made me want more than just two rolls. Yummy!\n- Garlic Chicken: flavor overload in my mouth! Couldn't get enough of this.\n- Ahi Poki: FRESH FRESH FRESH TUNA! It almost felt as if the fish were swimming in my mouth.\n- Tempura Philly Roll: Fried. Cream Cheese. Fresh Salmon. I can't ask for a better combination.\n\nAll their sushi is extremely fresh and they do sushi right. Make sure you order accordingly because they will charge your ass for leftovers. For dessert, make sure you get the \""808 Special\"", tempura-battered bananas and strawberries topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream with a dallop of whipped cream. *drools. \n\nWith a party of 14, the service was exceptional. Our waitress kept us happy with our Sake Bombs and kept up with our nonstop demands for food.\n\nThey, also, have a pretty decent \""Happy Hour\"", which consists of $1.50 Small Beers and $3.00 Big Beers. So, order a Big Beer and a round of Sake and you've got yourself set for about 10 Sake Bombs! Yes!\n\nSo, we walked into this place starving and left this place with our bellies full. We didn't even wanna walk the Strip, we just wanted go back to our hotel rooms and pass out. I toast Island Sushi with their $2 Sake Bombs! Yay!

"The first time I watched Cold Case was after it had run for about a year on Danish television. At the time it came to the TV it nearly drowned in 4 or 5 other American crime shows aired roughly the same time.I saw it and I was bored to death. The substandard actors with the self righteous faces and morals were a pain in the behind. The entire premise that so much money was given a team of investigators to solve murders dating back 10-20-30 or even 60 years seems so unlikely.The time is also a factor as they only have 50-60 min to tell the story which means that they get a break through just in the nick of time to solve the case and bring justice to surviving family members, if they are still alive. This combined with the ""personal"" problems and relations of the investigators which there HAS to be time for leaves the show a complete lackluster.I give it a 2-star rating because of the music i the end which is really the only reason for watching it....which you then of course won't do as that is TOO lame a reason for watching this crap.",negative,en

"Came here when they had recently opened and been coming back ever since. This restaurant is located on E. Flamingo nestled amongst other fine dining restaurants so why choose this place? well, because if you love meat and have a huge appetite then this is the place for you. Plus you will benefit of trying a Brazilian restaurant.\n\nThey offer a salad bar with a variety of salads, imported cheese, fresh vegetables, artisan breads and cured meats plus your sides such as rice and beans. At your table you will get the mashed potatoes, crispy fried polenta, caramelized bananas and of course the pao de qeuijo (warm cheese bread). Now for the meats, they have 11 different types of meat to include beef, pork, chicken and lamb. Their signature steak is the Picanha which is just so moist and full of flavor. They have all these male servers that bring the meat to you in skewers. \n\nIt's such a unique and fun experience and if you never experienced something like this before then definitely give it a try. I will also recommend, if you don't have a huge appetite then come for lunch as it's half the price of dinner and you will still benefit everything they have during dinner hours. Don't overload on the salad bar either so you can save room for the different types of meats.\n\nLastly, let me just recommend their signature drink, the Caipirinha. so good!",neutral,en

"There have been some harsh criticisms of Comanche Moon on IMDb. I think this is for three reasons. First, purists are disappointed that the mini-series is not exactly like the book. Second, it's not as good as the original Lonesome Dove. Finally, people like to complain on IMDb and the greatest films in the world will have bad comments.I would like to say that no movie is going to be as good as the book. That's just the way it is. Lonesome Dove wasn't as good as the novel it was based on. Additionally, the movie of Lonesome Dove had some things left out ans switched around. That's just they way its going to be with a film adaptation of anything. So its a futile argument when looking at Comanche Moon.I do agree it's not as good as the original Dove. But hey, nothing is. I know people that guide their lives by the lessons they learned from the Dove. If I was going to compare every book I read, movie I watched, and TV I viewed by Lonesome Dove; I would be perpetually unhappy.This is a made for TV miniseries based on a prequel to Lonesome Dave (the novel) and sequel to Dead man's Walk, and that's what you get. It's the best TV I've seen in years. It's a fun set up for Lonesome Dove. We get to learn about the history of the Rangers we came to know and love in Dove. Zahn does an amazing job in recreating Gus McCrae. Elizabeth Banks and Linda Forenelli (sp?) also do great jobs as creating characters that help fill in the past of the rangers and Newt.If/when it comes on again, I promise you'll enjoy it more than some crumby reality show.",positive,en

"CHOCOLATE CAKE SHAKE - Wowza! \n\nI really dig this place. I am amazed every time that I go in this restaurant, it runs like a well oiled machine. The employee's at the registers are very knowledgeable about the menu, the staff when you go to pick up your food all seemed like they really enjoyed and wanted to be at work. It's just an over all happy environment (even when they are extremely busy.) \n\nRecommendations: \n\nFirst off - you must, and I mean MUST get the Chocolate Cake Shake! If you can't tell I am a BiG fan!\n\n- Chopped Salad is delightful, consists of chopped lettuce and small pasta noodles with chicken, bacon, cabbage, tomatoes and house dressing. (It also comes with onion and gorgonzola cheese which I had taken off.) The salad also comes with one of their (spectacular) warm lemon poppy seed muffins. \n\n- Grilled Tuna Sandwich, tuna w/lettuce, tomato and tartar sauce. (You must love tuna to enjoy this sandwich.) \n\n-Big Beef, be prepared as this is a very large sandwich. It's Italian beef on french bread. The beef is well flavored and if you add cheddar cheese or mozzarella to the sandwich it is out of this world. \n\n- Onion rings: They are not to thick or thin and they are not over-battered like most onion rings are. They are light, crispy and awesome!\n\nI have yet to try the hot dogs, I plan to on my next Portillo's adventure. Hope you stop in and enjoy this place as much as I do. \n\n--One last time.....get the cake shake!--",positive,en

"I stayed immediately before Hurricane Irene. The elevator set up was slow and annoying, with one reserved for the bar and one that didn't seem to be in use at all. The minibar instead of a refrigerator was useless, particularly as there are no ice machines and the ice I requested when I checked in hadn't arrived by the time I checked out. The coffee maker/minibar area was lit up with no apparent on/off switch, so it glowed all night long. The television had only basic cable and WiFi was $15 per day.
The worst was the night of August 26, when airlines began to announce flight cancellations. I called the front desk to ask if I could extend my stay rather than check out as planned on August 27. I was told they would check and call me back. Thirty minutes later, I still hadn't received word so I called again and was told they were not extending any guests and were holding all available rooms for staff. This left me scrambling, after midnight, to find a hotel for the following night. The discourtesy in not extending my stay, and in not even bothering to let me know, was the last straw.",negative,en

"I was quite worried about staying in this hotel after reading the very mixed reviews, but I can honestly say it was very good. We arrived earlier than the check in time so our bags were taken. The concierge( is that what they are called?!) weren't great, apart from one of them. We got a taxi from the airport which turned out to be an expensive $90 but we didn't mind so much as we were tired from the flight. After returning to the hotel, we got our room- we had booked a queen- and found it was fine and big, bathroom was a bit small but what harm, and there was a wardrobe and kitchenette in the room too. There really was lots of space so would reccommend booking one of these rooms. We were on the 20th floor, but the lifts weren't as bad as what other reviews had stated so it was fine.
The room was cleaned to perfection everyday,even with the mess it was left in every monring, they did an immaculate job!Great service! The receptionists were fine- we didn't have to deal with them that much really!
It's in a fab location, and this is the main reason I would recommend it to people. There is a subway stop right outside the hotel, central park is a five minute walk one way, broadway the other and Times Square a ten minute walk, if not less! It really was fab! Fifth avenue was only a few minutes away too. It was just such a central location it made the hotel great. It is a little out-dated, but we weren't in the room that much apart from sleeping and getting changed!
We also went to a NYE Party in the Gansevoort. It was very good, not great though!!We were expecting a huge deal to be made of NYE but there was literally a 10 second countdown, it was just a different option to standing otu in Times Square- the crowds were back to our hotel.
All in all, a great trip. We visted from the 27th December to the 4th Jan, make sure to rap up warm, extremely cold -5 at one stage!! Thermal leggins and bodywarmers is the key :)
Restaurants: We ate in a couple of different restuarants, Tao and Ruby Tuesday being too- both great service and great food, although we have heard to make reservations for Tao early to avoid disappointed.

"It takes a rare movie to get better each time you see it. O Brother does that and then some. The first time I saw it, I have to admit I had never seen anything like it. Then I wanted to see it again, and now I'm up to double digits with this great movie, the Coen brothers' finest movie they've ever done, with Fargo and Hudsucker Proxy coming in a tight second and third for me.George Clooney gives the performance of his career playing Ulysses Everett McGee, a fast-talking know-it-all escaped convict who really doesn't know that much at all. Tim Blake Nelson and John Turturro are the perfect sidekicks for Clooney, particularly Nelson and his portrayal of Delmar, a loyal albeit uneducated fellow escapee. John Goodman is my favorite bit character as Big Dan, perfect. It reminds me of his part in Raising Arizona, he's just a perfect actor for this role. Coen brothers' favorites Holly Hunter and Charles Durning also provide memorable performances. Joel and Ethan Coen are masters of their trade. It's not like they try to win Academy Awards every time they make a film, they just try and tell a story that they want to tell, and it's entertaining. It's a loose adaptation of the Odyssey, and I mean loose for all of you Homer fanatics. It's just great.The most amazing part of this movie though is the coloring. I've watched how they got the dusty feel to the movie and I am still in awe just thinking about it. The coloring does become an important part of the movie. Great great movie.",positive,en

"I was not sure what to expect. I have an ipod touch and i like to read books. When i purchased them through Iceberg Reader (I-tunes book reader software) i did not have enough variety. I was surfing through amazon and realized they offered an application for the kindle so i bought random free books to see what it was about. This was one of the books. Very different and very steamy. The story is short and i read it in like three hours. Overall it really is a good story. It does leave you kind of hanging but i ordered the second book of the series and it picks up from this book. So i really do like the book. ( i dont give any information about the book because i think you should read it for yourself, it is free after all.

"I stayed here in April 2011. It was a very nice hotel with modern decor and a very friendly bell staff. We were able to drop our bags off in advance of check in. The front desk offered us many ideas for dinner close to the hotel because it was raining that day. The room was nice, I would've thought it was too small if I was staying multiple days but just for overnight it was fine. The bathroom was great and very clean. I had plenty of towels and toiletries. I was disappointed that night when I called housekeeping a few times around 9pm for extra tea and sugar and got no answer. Breakfast in the morning was very good, it was set up continental-style with both hot and cold items. The eggs, meats, and other items were very fresh and very good. They had a cooler with small bottle of juices and yogurts which were great. This hotel is very close to 30 Rock and Times Square but isn't in a busy area so it was ideal for a business stay.",positive,en

I read a sign in the elevator, on the final night of my stay, I was on the ground floor, about
the shuttle. If I had read the sign I would have known how to navigate with the shuttle. It would be good to put such a sign in the lobby. Also staff did not tell me that by walking on my first morning, after not having called ahead for the shuttle, I would be passing through streets with drug users/pan-handlers.
I would also suggest morning coffee be provided in the lobby as an amenity.

Le quartier est relativement calme pour rapport à l'agitation de Times Square. Si votre chambre donne côté rue, vous aurez plus d'agitation si vous donnez sur l'arrière, vous aurez le bruit des machines de climatisation mais le double vitrage fait très bien son effet.
La chambre est au standard US: un lit immense, une chambre très spacieuse, la salle de bains n'est pas immense mais elle est bien agencée et largement suffisante.

"""Maladroit"" voilà le premier mot qui m'est venu à l'esprit après la vision de ce film. Frank Darabont n'a pas cette fois réussi l'alliance entre grand cinéma à l'ancienne et bons sentiments qui faisait la réussite des ""Evadés"". Et pourtant, de prime abord le film par le début de son synopsis avait de quoi séduire. Mais l'ensemble est traiter de manière beaucoup trop simpliste, il y a des très bons et il y a des très méchants, les situations se suivent et se résolvent de façon peu crédible. Jim Carrey s'essaye quand à lui à la candeur d'un James Stewart chez Capra, mais cette fois l'acteur ne se montre pas convaincant faisant preuve d'une trop grande sobriété. Et c'est dommage tout cela car rendre hommage au grand cinéma classique, notamment au magnifique film de King Vidor ""La Grande Parade"", était très louable. Une déception.",negative,fr

"Stayed for five nights. Had to pay for Wi Fi! Isn't the room expensive enough? Older hotel from the 1920s renovated about seven years ago...but everything is tired....carpets worn, sink in the bathroom of my room was cracked; elevators are hopelessly slow, toilet paper holder, from IKEA, fell off the wall as I tried to use a few pieces of paper! And then there are the security goons wandering around with earphones...I encountered the same one twice within an hour in my elevator. Totally creepy. Coffee in the room is not free...instant at $3.50. Pool area and approach needs new carpeting..it is wet and dirty.....sad. Coffee shop...called 25 degrees or some such thing....blaring heavy metal and hip hop music at breakfast on Sunday morning....staff begrudgingly turned it down. Street bum comes in at breakfast and orders coffee for $3.29 but only has $3 so he starts panhandling in the restaurant guests. OK..It's LA...but who needs to pay $300 a night to be accosted by homeless bums? How ""hip"" is this dump? This hotel is an ATM requiring hefty fees from guests for no quality.",negative,en

"The rooms are much smaller than they appear on the internet (the staff tried to put us in an even smaller room than we reserved in a classic bait and switch scam). Even though we got a so called 2 room suite it was cramped and uncomfortable with a bad couch bed and 2 very uncomfortable double beds. Although It wasn't hot outside the room was stuffy and the air conditioning didn't work at all. After 2 attempts to fix this pile of junk the maintenance man said he couldn't fix it at all. The weekend management offered to put us in yet another room but since we'd already moved once we opted to remain in the same room. Then the toilet clogged up and after they snaked the line it didn't begin functioning until about 12 hours later. As for the free breakfast it was sparse and over represented in the advertisement. The breakfast room was over crowded with a bunch of rude, psychotic deadbeats who wanted their monies worth so we ate someplace else for breakfast every single day which was not part of the original plan. The front desk staff pretended to be nice but it was all an act, there was a certain level of condescension there which I did not appreciate at all. On our last day they turned off our room key's and the maid staff let us in without a questioning who we were (Thats a big red flag). When I inquired with the front desk they gave me some lame excuse about the card being magnetized. I felt they turned off our keys in retaliation for our numerous complaints regarding the air conditioning and their attempt to swindle us with a smaller cheaper room than what we paid for.
This place should be part of a corporate case study on bad management because it's a nice facility that's being run into the ground by poorly trained people who could care less about paying customers. I would not recommend this motel to my worst enemy or his dog. There are so many choices in San Diego do yourself a favor and find another place to stay.

I was told that the Buffet in the Sahara really sucks and we just wanted breakfast that was reasonable and good. I already had a club Sahara card and recommend anyone to get it because they nock about 1.00 off each item on the menu.\nI eat at the Caravan Cafe twice. The first time I ordered the Eggs/Hasbrowns/Wheat Toast/Bacon. I order eggs scrambled hard and they came out burnt and the Bacon was so hard it was crappy. The only thing that was good was the Toast. My friends didn't complain but they were hungover and just needed food. I thought that it was a blah version of Denny's.\nThe next day I ordered the Cinnamon Apple French Toast and Chocolate Milk. The milk was a large portion and so was the French Toast however it was very sweet and such a large portion I was stuffed but was not totally impressed.\nI will say that the prices are reasonable for vegas but the quality could be better. Maybe I just don't know what to order.\nWould suggest because of being 24/7 but think of a B rated Denny's,negative,en

L'arrivée à l'hotel vers 14h, le 27 nous a mis dans l'ambiance: un portier a pris nos bagage pour faire 10 mètres jusqu'au hall d'accueil de l'hotel et a insisté de manière agressive pour que je lui donne un pourboire, je n'avais pas encore de monnaie...
Ensuite, il nous afallu laisser nos bagages à la consigne ( 1,75 dollar par bagage) car les chambres n'étaient disponibles qu'à partir de 16 h ( pas de petits profits...), ""rebelote"" au départ, notre avion étant à 22h et les chambres devant être libérées à 12h...
Les chambres pourtant jolies et assez spacieuses et équipées, n'étaient pas insonorisées et l'on pouvait entendre outre le bruit de la rue , des sirènes de police et d'ambulance, fréquentes à NY, la climatisation de l'hotel à l'extérieur en bruit sourd et continu...

"The hotel had good service and a great location in Times Square steps from all Broadway Shows but I will not stay there again. I have never stayed in a room with thinner walls. There was no privacy. I could hear everything done and said next door. They weren't yelling or raising their voice, but i was woken up by a normal tone conversation. Heard every single word they said, crystal clear. In addition I could hear the very loud toilet every time it was flushed, as well as the roll-up blinds....it sounded as if someone was inside the room. I will not stay at this particular Westin simply because I don't like to feel like I have to whisper and listen to everything my neighbor Nate and his wife had to say....and yes I know him by first name...I also know he likes Elvis and has a healthy marriage...

"I booked a room at the Hyatt Embarcadero several months prior to our August visit. My husband and I were in San Francisco for a long weekend of baseball, sight seeing and shopping. I selected this hotel based on reviews and location. The prices were more on the steep side, but still comprable to other places I was looking.
An upgraded room with bay views on a higher floor was offered, as we were checking in. We declined as we were happy with the original room/price we reserved and I had paid for the room in full at the time of booking. The gentleman working the desk nodded and agreed. We were given a printout of the booked room to sign and acknowledge the number of days, etc. As we had just discussed the lack of upgrade and the cost, looking over the sheet in great detail seemed a moot point. Lesson learned. At check out, four days later, we were asked how we wanted to pay. Pay? The room should have been paid for already. As it turns out, we had been given an upgraded room. Based on the shoebox size of the room and the fact that the bay view was only viewable from the left had side of the balcony if you stood in just the right place, I had no reason to believe we had been in an upgraded room. The room was clean, but that was all it really had going for it. I definitely wouldn't have called it an upgrade, even on the 17th floor. It was a different gentleman at check out who was very condensending and treated us as if we were idiots. We told him that there must have been some miscommunication at check in and that we had declined a room upgrade. He more or less rolled his eyes and went to find a supervisor. We were met halfway and ended up paying for a night and a half of the upgraded rate. The total cost we paid was more than I ever would have paid to stay in that room at that hotel, but we were pushed for time to get to the airport and I understood that the services had already been provided. We will make sure to double check all papers at the time we check in from now on. I felt that the issue could have been handled in a better manor and that the clerk checking us in should have made more of a point in showing the actual price, since it was different than the one discussed. Would I recommend the Hyatt? Probably not. Based on service alone I won't be back and I wouldn't want anyone I like treated that way.",neutral,en

タイトルからして重く、心が折れそうな気持ちで読み始めました。 娘から拒絶をされたのは、孫が5歳になりお祝いの集合写真を写した1ヶ月後でした。私自身、娘を傷つけていたことは、薄々気づいていたのだと思います。 拒絶されるまでは、たわいの無い親子ゲンカ程度と思って言い過ぎた時には謝り、理不尽だと思う時には、音信普通にしたり、そうして娘をコントロールしていたのだと思います。 カウンセリングに行く前にと色々本を読み漁り、スタートはここからでした。 今は、私の母を亡くし、要介護5の父を見ながら私自身の親子関係を見つめています。心臓の弱い母は私を産んでから病気がちで、ガンで手術したのは私が小学生１年生。参加日も遠足も父がついて来たり、父兄がいなかったり、 入院中は毎日病室へ行き、憶えているのは退院してから、放射線治療に付き添って行ったこと。心細かった母の通院に使命感を感じて付いて行っていました。 小学１年生が出来ることと言えば、せいぜい誰か医師か看護師を呼ぶぐらいだったでしょう。片時も離れずにいることが幸せでした。今なら小学生１年生にこんな思いをさせた大人は父だったのかと、、、,neutral,ja

"I am a Ritz Cartlon/Marriott Rewards Elite member, and needless to say I have traveled to my fair share of Marriott chains. I have never come across one location as bipolar as this one! I say this because of the dual nature of the hotel. The lobby is exquisite! A lot of money has obviously been spent on renovations/touch-ups/upgrades etc. I traveled to this location with my husband for the weekend. We were blown away by the service and look of the lobby. Check-in was a breeze, staff were very friendly and all. Now once we got into the room on the 44th floor (which I was very happy to have gotten), that was another story. Rooms are OLD and SMALL and COLD. Granted it was about 64F outside, but the thermostat read 69. This is fine, if you like the cold. I chucked it up to the room not being occupied, but it was so musty, and being an asthmatic person, my chest and nose were already acting up. We went out for dinner and returned around midnight and the room was FREEZING. We tried to adjust the thermostat and it was impossible to! We ended up increasing fan speed instead, in error. So my husband called the front desk and we were told that heating/cooling becomes central with certain temperatures, and guests cannot alter these. I was shocked! First time I've heard that. So we asked for a space heater, and were told its against fire regulations (very understandable). We were then offered extra blankets and the nerve of the receptionist to ask: ""WOULD YOU LIKE SOME WARM MILK AS WELL?"" Now I don't know if that was sarcasm of if a 30 and 40-yr old woman and man have acutally benefitted from ""warm milk"" in a cold musty hotel room! That, to me, was the most ridiculous solution to a problem ever offered to me by hotel staff!!! I could not have checked out soon enough. I cut my stay in that hotel short for 1 night (probably not a big deal, but my husband and I were PISSED!!!)I know that this may be a one-off, but I am now fighting a cold/residual asthma attack and thanks to them my entire Saturday morning was spent searching for a hotel in the middle of a city preparing for the NATO summit!!!

"Went to Thai House on a Thursday around 8PM. A few others were in the restaurant but not crowded at all. Like other reviewers, I liked the dress of the servers and the decor of the place was pretty cool. I sat in a booth by myself and was immediately greeted by the server with a menu.\n\nI ordered a Green Tea Sake...SOOO GOOD! It came in a little glass bottle and it called Sake2Me. I plan to buy it!\n\nAs I enjoyed my sake, I ordered the steamed shrimp dumplings. Totally not what I expected...two roll-like, dough things came out and it tasted like it looked...just like raw dough stuffed with lots of crunchy lettuce-like pieces and tiny chopped meat. I didn't see any shrimp, not even mini shrimp. I was thinking they brought me the wrong item but when I didn't eat my dough, the waiter said \""You don't like your shrimp dumpling?\"" I didn't have the heart (or the energy after a long day of travel) to say anything except \""I want to have room for my Pad Thai\"". So, I awaited my Chicken Pad Thai hoping it was what I am used to.\n\nThe Pad Thai wasn't bad...not great, but not bad. Once in a while, I got the taste of mayonaisse but I was starving at this point and it did the trick. i actually took it back to my hotel for lunch the next day but decided in the morning that the taste wasn't worth the risk of Pad Thai all over my rental car.\n\nI'm not sure if I'll go back to Thai House. i will certainly look for an alternative next time I'm in town. If I'm starved and can't find any other place, I'll probably give Thai House another shot...I'll just stay away from anything that says \""dumpling\"".",negative,en

"I would first like to say that the location of this place was easy for me to find. I rated Kathy's Southern Cooking 2-stars for the following reasons. #1 Customer Service/ Etiquette was very poor. In my opinion when an order is placed and you do not have that particular item (i.e. Peach Cobbler) available at that moment, you are to express a little sympathy or at least be a TINY bit apologetic for that item not being available at the customers request. To ask the customer \""What do you want me to do about it\""? Is extremely rude!!! I would have gladly waited for said item had the man at the front counter had a different approach. I took off 2 stars just for this particular reason. There are certain ways you should speak to people. I understand that when cooking any southern meal/food that it takes a bit of time. I was very excited when I walked into this establishment. Poor service etiquette is very unacceptable. And #2 Food was just above average. I ordered a catfish dinner for myself w/ a side of greens & also ordered a chicken dinner & a hot-link w/ banana pudding for someone else. We both agreed that the Mac N' Cheese was at best rated a 1 out of 10. It tasted exactly like the Mac n cheese from KFC! The greens that I ordered were very good w/ hot sauce. They weren't seasoned heavily at all, I assume to give you the option to add seasoning yourself. The mashed potatoes & gravy were delicious! No complaints. The hot-link was covered in BBQ sauce & was regular, nothing too good or too bad. I have tasted better, I'm not sure where they get theirs from. Both the catfish and the chicken were good!!! The batter for both was good as well! And the banana pudding was pretty tasty. I did not get to try the cornbread that was supposed to be included with my dinner because unfortunately, they left it out. My overall opinion is that the food is good, the service is extremely poor. I actually still would have come to this place but due to my experience, I will gladly return to M&M's Soul Food Cafe! I hope that this review is helpful to someone when going Kathy's Southern Cooking.",negative,en

"After coming here for the last 3 1/2 years, I still consider the M Resort property as the hidden gem of Vegas. For me, the title used to belong to Green Valley Ranch about 9 years ago. Actually after staying here for a short weekend early 2010, I've never stayed anywhere else. Just fell in love with the M Resort. Although my crazy Vegas days are over now and a dream weekend for me would rather be best experienced in a yoga camp - Vegas is still a great place to relax and unwind. \n\nAt the first glance, the M Resort just looks like an off-Strip resort property created for gaming with a gaming floor as big as that of Caesar's but with only less than 400 rooms. But I was completely mesmerized by everything the M Resort had from its spacious modern accommodations ( with amazing views of the Strip ) to its numerous dining options. Even the pool is top notch and pretty relaxing. Their Spa is even better than some of the more popular ones in the Strip. Actually their rooms are even more spacious than the mini-suites of the Rio and the Venetian. Which is good since I don't gamble. \n\nThe M Resort is where Cantor Gaming introduced their Sports Book template which is probably the best in the world and is presently continuing to revolutionize Sports Gaming which can be experienced at the Tropicana, Hard Rock, and the Venetian among others. Actually the Sports Book looks like a Wall Street trading floor. Not surprising since its from Cantor. You know its one of those companies that managed to survive the recession without a bailout. I can watch anything there from soccer to the NFL. Plus, that high-tech mobile device is pretty convenient. Definitely one of the best Sports Book in Vegas. \n\nAnother one which is one of the city's the best is the famous Studio B Buffet. Totally amazing food selection with free beer and wine. Total great value with good service as compared to the ones in the Strip. Besides the Buffet, I also like dining at the Vig Deli.\n\nOverall, the friendly service provided by the staff of the M Resort from the front desk up to the pool is excellent. They also have some of the most beautiful servers in the city - I guess the former beauty queen wife of the former owner played a big role in this one. I'm glad the new owners maintained their eye for beauty since its really part of the Vegas experience. \n\nWell, my wish for my favorite M Resort property in 2014 is continued growth in the US economy and critical mass.",positive,en

"If you are not a fan of fondue, you may not enjoy this place. If you are, you have already probably been there. But, in case you haven't, you should definitely go. My wife and I have been fortunate enough to leave in three cities that have them close by. We often go and only get the Wisconsin Cheese Trio and the Peanut Butter Chocolate fondue because that will pretty much do the trick! \n\nBut we did get a full course a couple of times and were not disappointed! The experience itself is pretty neat! The seating is as private as you want it too with a pull curtain for your booth and everything... very romantic. You get a quick course on how to dip and eat your food and the server is always nearby for anything you need. \n\nFor a full course and a bottle of wine you can get out of there just under $100 which, I feel, is well worth it.

"This is the last stay in LA because of my business transfer to Ohio. It was very lucky we can have US$75/night ++ on SPG site for last memory. Room and bed are okay, bathroom is kept very clean. But something is not enough.... What's up?
The first, the area this hotel is belonged to is surrounding airport of LAX, and nothing special is here. We have one dinner at hotel's restaurant and bar, but taste is poor, it maybe from my choice? I don't recommend to others.
Carpark is very expensive, they charge us US$12 per each night even we are stayed here. Some of uncertain people looks roaming about in night time. It is a little bit scaring.

"Went here for their soft opening so maybe I should cut them some slack, but I think I'll just keep it real. While the concept isn't new - it's new to Pittsburgh. Here's how it works:\n\n-Get a bowl and go to the buffet style set up\nStation 1 - noodles/meat\n-Choose noodles (rice noodles, rotini, lo mein)\n-Fill it with your choosing of raw \""blank\"" (chicken, beef, scallops, shrimp...)\n\nStation 2 - veggies\n-Continue to fill small bowl with additional toppings of veggies (mushrooms, peppers, water chestnuts, etc.)\n\nStation 3 - Sauce\n-Pick up a small bowl\n-Choose preferred sauce (variety of sweet, tangy, savory, spicy sauces available)\n\nStation 4 - Grill\n-Take you bowl of noodles, meat, and veggies and your small bowl of sauce up to the grill\n-One of the grillers will take it from you and you stand there as it's cooked and they put it on a plate when it's done and you take it and go back to your table. \n\nLast stop - enjoy your \""made to order\"" meal\n\nI will say that I enjoyed the food - I had the chili garlic sauce during my first trip up to the buffet stations with chicken and steak and some veggies and then I chose the BD teriyaki sauce with scallops and shrimp on my next round. I definitely preferred the chili garlic sauce - if you like spice then I think you'll enjoy that.\n\nWe ordered a pitcher of Strawberry Sangria and it tasted more like a melted Strawberry Daiquiri - uber sweet with no wine taste at all. It was the low point of the meal.\n\nThey gave us a complimentary dessert - the brownie sundae. Oh my yumminess - it was huge so we all shared it and couldn't even finish it. \n\nOverall the experience was good but somewhat generic having been to similar chains before in other cities. I think it will do well in Pittsburgh initially until the novelty has worn off.",negative,en

"If I could give it a 3.5 stars I'd do that instead.\n\nFor this trip to Vegas I decided to try out Craftsteak because of two things; 1) my buddy Henzel highly recommended it and, 2) Cherlynn N, a \""friend\"" of mine through Yelp also gave it a 4.5 stars and not only do I love her reviews but our tastes are very similar when it comes to eateries.\n\nI would have also started my review exactly the way Cherlynn N wrote her first paragraph about Craftsteak (except for the bf part) and Tom Colicchio on Top Chef.\n\nNow let me break it down.\n\nAtmosphere was excellent except for the cold air condition draft that was blowing direct to my gf. Otherwise it was hip, good lighting, and the noise level was good where we could talk to each other without yelling across the table.\n\nWe decided to go with the pre fixe meal of $140 each for the wagyu beef selections. This pre fix includes a cup each of their lobster bisque, 3 half orders of any of their salads, 3 half orders of any of their sides, 3 dessert. Being the wagyu filet my lady decided to get was just $105 by itself, this pre fix deal is worth it!\n\nThe bread - 5 stars. Let's say they were like freshly baked hawaiian bread but only lighter, brushed with butter on top and sprinkled with sea salt. We would go back to Craftsteak just for this bread! You get six pieces at the table. We asked for another tray and also had an order to-go. Ain't no shame to our game!\n\nLobster bisque - 3 stars. I was so looking forward to this as it's knows as one of their signature dishes. While it was tasty it was overly \""herbed\"". That blew it. The bisque at Farallon in SF is much better.\n\nAppetizers: Caesar salad, Roasted beet salad, Italian Buffalo Mozzarella. The Caesar was very good. It's not chopped romaine lettuce but served whole leaf. The dressing is tasty and light. I would order that again. The beet salad was also very good. Various different types of beets. Another order again. The mozzarella fell flat, not big deal.\n\nOh and we also ordered the seared scallops which were very tasty.\n\nTwo glasses of wine and we were ready for the 2nd half of the meal and that's where things actually went relatively downhill.\n\nSides: mushroom assortment, potato puree, spinach. All three to me were really no big deal. So not much to write about here.\n\nSteaks: As I said my lady had the wagyu filet while I decided to order the wagyu skirt, their most popular cut. This is what I hated. Both steaks came served to us ALREADY CUT INTO PIECES!! This is like the cardinal rule of steak! Pre-cut steak just lets all the juices out. WTH? Why do they do that? So I tried to let that go and just hope that the taste of the steaks make up for it. It didn't. I just couldn't tell the difference between wagyu and a nice choice cut. Made me think that wagyu continues to be overrated in my book or I just still haven't found a meat establishment that can win me over about wagyu beef.\n\nDessert: So we had the popular monkey bread and they gave us 3 other complimentary desserts; a lemon thing, two scoops of ice cream (strawberry and lemon), and a small dish of fruit. By then we were already stuffed and had a few bites of each. Again no big deal.\n\nBottom line: Craftsteak will still be on our list to go the next time we're in Las Vegas. But instead, we would sit at the bar, have a couple serving of their bread, some appetizers and continue on with the evening plans from there.\n\nSorry Tom - Please pack your knives and go. And don't ever cut my steak again!",negative,en

"We stayed at theCourtyard City Center for 2 nights to attend a wedding in Charlotte. We found the accommodations to be CLEAN and comfortable, not extravagant. The set-up is kind of different, though probably due to the downtown location. The rooms begin on the sixth floor of the building- above the 5-story parking garage. The standard king room was a good size with many amenities (though lacking a refrigerator, which we were able to obtain by calling the front desk). King bed was a little soft but tolerable for two nights. Excellent front desk people- very accommodating throughout our stay. Nice flat screen TV with HBO and the usual cable stations. Dressing area was small- only one sink and a small vanity- not a lot of room for toiletries, etc. Shower and toilet were in a separate area- nice shower head with strong stream. Though we were on the 6th floor of the building, we faced the street and street sounds were easily heard (drunks singing and screaming at 2 PM on a Saturday night). The city of Charlotte is very nice and CLEAN. The location of the hotel is very convenient- it's a short walk of a few blocks to all of the downtown restaurants and theaters. Our wedding was at the Ritz Carlton, just three short blocks away. If you have a free morning or afternoon and are visiting Charlotte for the first time, I recommend Copperline Tours- see my review. We booked through the Marriott website and paid $129 a night. Parking is $10/ day- not bad for downtown. The is a small cafe in the lobby- good for a quick breakfast and reasonable.",neutral,en

"The only word to really describe this stay is \""bummer.\"" \nArrived 20 mins before the 3pm check in time and was told the room was ready but it would cost $20 for the \""early\"" check in, at the rate of $1 per minute. Bummer... so we sat and waited 20 mins and then returned to the desk to check in at 3pm. I wonder what the hotel gained from this situation? \n\nOn our second day we called for more towels, and were told no problem. Waited an hour and no towels came so we called again and again were told they would be right over. They still never came. Bummer. Called again on the third day and finally got more towels but no full sized bath towels like our first set, they were all hand towels and wash cloths. Weird..\n\nI enjoyed the pool one afternoon but the rack marked \""pool towels\"" was empty, must be an overall shortage. They have a bar in the lobby that has a walk up window that opens to the pool area, it seemed like it would be a nice set up to order drinks from the pool, but of the 4 days we were there it was never open including the weekend.

"Near impossible to not have dust or bubbles underneath, not wide enough
2 main issues I have with this screen protector: The width of this protector is either exactly the width of the screen or just slightly more narrow. Either way, one side of my screen would have a single column of pixels all the way down exposed, and the next column in from those would give off this iridescent glow coming through the edge of the protector. Was very distracting. It is nearly impossible to place this without getting dust bubbles underneath. Once dust gets under, there is no removing it (adhesive undercoat). I had a few bubbles on my first attempt so I removed it and used the 2nd one hoping to be more careful, but it ended up with more and was distracting enough to get me to remove that one as well, so now I am looking for a new screen protector.",neutral,en

"The premise of Cabin Fever starts like it MIGHT have something to offer. A group of college teens after finals (in the fall?) goes to a resort cabin in the woods where one by one they are attacked by an unseen flesh eating virus.Unfortunately, the first paragraph is where any remote elements of film quality stop. Cabin Fever is little more than college kids looking for sex, booze, talking non-stop about nothing, and seeing how many F-bombs they can get into 1:40 minutes or however long this mess is.The kids act and react stupidly to everything around them. One of them for instance discovers that the skin virus has infected her legs, so what does she do? She keeps shaving her legs failing to take proper medical attention for her wounds. The scene is little more than a gross out. In another scene, Rider Strong from ""Boy Meets World"" gets bitten on the hand by some kid who only says ""Pancakes"" and likes to do karate kicks on those who sit next to him. If you can figure out the reason for why the ""Pancakes"" kid was included, I'd love to know. Anyway, Rider pets a wild dog and goes off to wash his bitten hand in a most likely contaminated creek. Another kid likes to drop F-bombs in reacting to everything around him and shoot squirrels. Why? Your guess is as good as mine!Rider Strong is the ONLY kid with any recognition in this movie. He tries to calm people down in-between the yelling and screaming and F*** Y**! bombs that people are throwing around. When the kids aren't yelling, they are having or talking about sex or talking nonsense to the other adult characters who are EVEN MORE (if that is possible)idiotic than the kids! The idiot cop with an IQ of 60 at best may be one of the WORST acting jobs I have ever seen in a movie. You talk about people not playing with a full deck, this dork doesn't even know how to find the cards! LOL! I was like, ""Will you PLEASE shut up already?!"" He makes the kid actors look like geniuses! The only part that I sort of liked was Rider's scary story (although gory) about the deranged bowling alley guy. In interviews, Rider said that he had a great deal of respect for director Eli Roth. But the problem is that Mr. Roth appears to be going for little more than shock and gore. There are far too many bad things about this movie for Mr. Roth to get any credit. I wish I could agree with Rider and find something likable about this movie. Maybe the fall scenery in the beginning? Actually, Rider Strong JUST saves this movie from being a 1! Hopefully, he was compensated for this junk!",negative,en

The side dishes are inconsistent, but at their worst are pretty good. The only negative is that sometimes dishes can be a little sweet and... cinnamon-y? Especially the corn salsa and refried beans.\n\nThe service is laid-back and can occasionally be sloppy.

"Sadly, I discovered Kofusion only a couple months before I graduated but once I discovered the place, I quickly became a regular! \n\nFirstly, people should recognize the restaurant for what it is: Korean fushion food. Thus, there's a wide variety of sushi, my personal favorite: hwe dup bap (like sashimi salad) and a smaller selection of hot (but still great--scallops anyone?) entrees that I usually have no interest in because I love sushi that much. \n\nIf you need a quick sushi fix, dollar sushi Sundays (1 roll = $1) will definitely satisfy your cravings. There are 10 rolls that are offered at that price and they are definitely more of an American style sushi roll (read: little to no raw fish). At first I was really disappointed by this, but I honestly felt like the other rolls were good enough (Big Roll! Coconut Roll!) that I didn't mind at all and eat about $15-$20 worth of sushi anyway. Yes, I am a sushi whore. \n\nIf you really want good sushi (with more raw fish or more interesting combinations), Kofusion is still the place to go. Their sushi menu is surprisingly extensive with your typical simple salmon rolls to rainbow-type rolls and more. It's about $1-$2 dollars more expensive than the other places in town but I've never felt like my rolls weren't worth the cost. \n\nFinally, Kristina is my favorite waitress. Maybe she remembered me for my order (hwe dup bap--seriously, try it if you love raw fish, it is divine) or maybe because I loved her so much I tipped well, but after just a few weeks of going weekly, a lot of the waiters remembered me and greeted me warmly. As a sushi lover, it doesn't really get any better than this. \n\nI'm not going to lie, Kofusion hits your wallet pretty hard but in the world of sushi, I don't find them especially more expensive than other sushi places that offer the same variety and quality of rolls. One recommendation I have is to try and get a roll (i.e. Big Roll--that's the one I had) wrapped in soy/rice paper. For those that don't like sushi because of the seaweed, this is a great alternative. For those that still love sushi, try it anyway--it's a great substitution that's worth it to get on its own once in awhile. \n\nI will forever miss Kofusion now that I'm not in the area so please, go get the hwe dup bap, Big Roll, Coconut Roll, or even the thai curry for me please!",neutral,en

The beds were like sleeping on slab of cement.The breakfast is $6.95 per person, what I usually get for free at other Best Westerns.

"This place is always ridiculously busy. Their food, pretty good, but due to the wait that is usually involved I usually steer clear of this place. We went here very early (~4 PM) for our large party to get seated and there wasn't too much of a wait, but if I have to always go here at 4 to be seated without a really long wait, there's no way I would eat here. We had an appetizer, pizza, and dessert. The appetizer was the GuacaTony, which was amazing. It had a very large portion of fresh guacamole with perfectly crispy cheesy pizza/flatbread to eat it with. I also had some of the toasted ravioli which was nicely breaded and toasty, with a bit of spicy kick to it. I wasn't too impressed with the pizza though. We had ordered a pizza on the thin crust wheat, and it looked like a bunch of pizza toppings placed on a large, circular cracker. The wheat crust was not very flavorful and was burnt in a few areas. The pizza cookie was rich, decadent, and delicious, although I highly recommend sharing this with at least 2 other people.",negative,en

"First, let's get the ""hoopla"" out of the way.Hedy Lamarr was regarded as one of the most beautiful of women and the movies were a perfect medium for the many to see her beauty on screen.Here we have Hedy as a young fresh-faced 20 year old speaking in her native Austrian.I recently bought a 1990 uncensored version of this 1932/3 classic.Yes we see a brief close up of Hedy bare from the waist up but although she filmed the swimming & runaway horse scenes naked, the director Gustav Machaty uses the cover of branches, reflections in puddles, medium and long shots to show her thus in this famous scene; so don't go imagining there are any lascivious close ups or clinches.Her boyfriend , Pierre Nay keeps his clothes on at all times.Yes, fairly daring for its day but how innocous it looks now through 2003 eyes.As other learned reviews have stated this film should be looked at for the imagary, expressionism, and allegorical statements it makes with pictures of drops of water forming a ripple on the surface of a pale of water, farm machinery, landscapes etc.Sweet sounding strings run for most of ""Extase's"" length and the film has a ""feel"" of a transition between silent and sound in its direction and concept.The script is highly minimalist and economical the story being mainly imparted through the medium of facial and bodily gestures with just a few words of German spoken by the actors with English subtitles beneath.Even these few words seem almost superflous in the general lyrical vein which runs through the film.Put very simply this is the story of a young girl who marries a much older man (why we are never told and what did Eva see in him anyway?Money?), who is then trapped in an unconsumated and loveless marriage.She then returns to her father having left her husband and her father has to lie to his son in law.After a ride on her horse Eva decides to take a swim in the buff and loads up her clothes onto her horse's saddle.However her horse gets romantic notions itself and gallops off to greet its stablemate.Hedy rushes out of the lake naked and tries to recover her mount but an engineer at work sees and retrieves the horse then looks around for its owner.And so the romance is born.Her husband seeing that his rival must win Eva, later decides to shoot himself but I thought this was rather illogical and its main weakness bearing in mind his previous loveless relationship with Eva.Despite being a 1990 reissue title on VHS, the sound being 70 years old, is a bit soft and with background crackles, in line with films of its age.After a period of mourning our handsome boyfriend obviously is so in love with Eva he imagines her as a mother with an infant so we have to assume they live happily ever after.Just let the imagary wash over you and disabuse your mind of the style of films even of late 1930's vintage.This is a lyrical piece that can be enyoyed for its own sake and not just for its eye catching title.I gave it 7/10.",positive,en

"I went here for my niece's bachelorette party last May. We got a suite with a beautiful view of the pool and the strip. I can't really say much about guest service because we didn't really use it except to ask for more towels, which we never got. With 9 women in one room, we had to have a lot of towels! But the folks at the front desk were very courteous and friendly. The pool area was huge with a dj nearby and servers around for drinks. The hotel itself is beautiful, very modern. Better than other hotels I've stayed in Vegas.",neutral,en

Thai food with no pork is weird.Tom yam one person is absolutely pathetic - two prawns and one small bowl for 20+ is just plain waste of money. Nam prik was ok but def not Thai style. Green curry tastes weird and beef is local beef with no quality and overcooked chewy crap. Only pineapple fried rice was the closest to Thai.Rest of the food are Malaysian influenced. Could have been better.,neutral,en
"The premise of this book was interesting, cloning Jesus Christ. The story the author wrote was an interesting one, but needed help in transitioning from one sub story to the next. The reader was left wondering how two different stories intersected. And just when you thought you understood what was happening, another sub plot was introduced. While I enjoyed the book, I have to admit that it was one of the most difficult to follow",neutral,en
"Great food, their ribs were excellent and I will be back for more of their awesome BBQ. Sauces were good too, and everything was BBQ'ed nicely.

"09/13/12 DINNER\n\nSpouse, M, and I have now dined here five different times. \n\nThe pizzas have always been stellar, particularly the Neapolitan style. This place is UNIQUE, in that they have TWO pizza ovens, brought in from Italy: a Neapolitan and a Roman! The styles of pizza crusts are completely different. TRY BOTH, but I'll stick mostly to the more traditional Neapolitan.\n\nThey have also been quite good with non-pizza items.\n\nThis time, tho, there were a few misses, thus only 4 stars. WHY DO I ONLY REVIEW WHEN THERE ARE PROBLEMS! Sigh.\n\nI'll start with the PROS. As I said, the pizzas are stellar. I have to say, of all of the Neapolitan pizzas offered in Las Vegas Valley, this place serves my second favorite crust and topping. (My fave so far? DOCG. A close third place? Settebello.) At their Super Bowl party, earlier this year, their \""lamb chop lollipops\"" were INCREDIBLE. Perhaps the best lamb chops I've had in this country. (The best lamb I've ever had? Karoo Lamb, only available in South Africa.)\n\nNow, the CONS, IE the problems yesterday. They have an octopus dish, grilled and served on a salad. The critter was overcooked, so it was tough and not was flavorful as I would have liked it. I didn't say anything, I probably should have. Also, all of their salads can be a little overdressed, but I have to say that the content of the dressings is always spot on. Next up, M thought it rather weird they would serve a cheese bread with the wonderful mozzarella+item platters. I did too, but it didn't ruin it for me. And lastly, WHY do the wines-by-the-glass prices have to be so high? I understand, their wine list is truly astounding (they currently have a GEORGE Pinot Noir by the glass, that's fantastic stuff, and rare to find on a WBTG list), but drinking there is always exorbitant, we ALWAYS wince upon the arrival of the bill. (FOOTNOTE: You can get a TASTE of any wine for 20% of the glass price, so I got to try 2 sips of that GEORGE yesterday. YAY!)\n\nSo I would say, GO HERE. GET PIZZA. I think we've tried every pizza, they are ALL fantastic. Get the lamb chops, if on the menu. Bring extra cash for the drinks. And enjoy.",neutral,en
"I like to give places a chance. I'm not a harsh critic, and don't always let a couple bad reviews steer me away from trying a place. In this case, I should have listened. \n\nFirst off, it wasn't horrible. The food was OK, nothing special. The service wasn't the worst I've had, as the waitress was attentive, but she mumbled and didn't really provide much more than subpar service. \n\nOverall my experience was underwhelming, and forgettable. I probably wouldn't choose to eat here again.",negative,en

"Отличная кухня! Каждый раз заезжаем именно перекусить. Повара грираят на славу, действительно, как домашняя еда. Отличная подача блюд. \nВ этом году открыли бассейн, но это скорее минус. Могут пользоваться её только отдыхающие, но и другие посетители. Соответственно, много грязи в бассейне (плавали жучки, посетители могут сморкаться туда и т.д.) и много пьяных. Купаться было неприятно. \nКонтроля как такового нет: дети прыгают с бортиков, пока родители ""отдыхают"" на шезлонге, пьяные плавают... Бассейн подкачал. \nВ целом всё хорошо. Усилить контроль в зоне бассейна и будет отлично!",positive,ru

"I cannot recommend NOWTV Broadband.
Although the switch from my previous internet provider went okay, the automated payment on their website does not work, even though I've double-checked the details and manually provided (by phone) exactly the same payment details and this transaction has gone through successfully.
Additionally, the standard NOWTV router provided has a very limited WiFi range compared to other routers that I've had before and you might find that you'll need to buy WiFi extenders to ensure coverage even over a relatively small area.
Furthermore, it's been incredibly difficult to contact NOWTV customer services and the service provided once I got through to them has not been of particularly good quality (the person that I spoke to recently did not speak good English and was difficult to understand).",negative,en
