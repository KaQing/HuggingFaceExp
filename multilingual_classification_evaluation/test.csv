"Il y a bien des scènes ridicules jouées par Rosanna Arquette lors de ses discussions avec les personnes de l'au-delà sous une musique d'orgue à l’américaine. Elle a des visions du futur, également et les personnes dans l'assistance sont bien choisies pour des parodies. On voit bien que les acteurs sont amateurs et que la mise en scène est classique. Le déroulé manque d'intérêt et ma plupart des dialogues sont conventionnels, surtout chez la medium. Je n'ai pas aimé, d'autant que, plus récent, il y a ""L'illusionniste"" de Neil Burger avec Edward Norton qui est beaucoup, beaucoup mieux, surtout sur la partie medium et son explication.",negative,fr

"Recently bought what turned out to be a very poor quality 32 inch Acer monitor that developed a fault. As per other retail web sites I tried to leave a review on the Argos web site against the monitor highlighting my issues. Argos web site would not let me do so thus giving the potential purchaser, myself included originally, that this monitor was great as per the very positive reviews on there.

"I keep going back to Papago, hoping my dining experience will change. Mainly because I LOVE the Orange Blossom and their pizza.\n\nEach time is the same. I walk in and sit down, wait, then wait some more. Even though the place is filled, the wait staff can be found standing and talking to each other behind the bar. I witness the people next to us go to the bar for a beer because they were tired of waiting for someone to take their order. Last time I checked, this place was not self-serve. \n\nJust last week my husband and I decided to try Papago one last time. This time our strategy was to sit at the bar to avoid waiting for someone to take our order. The bartender behind the bar was nice. He served our drinks quickly. \n\nHowever, what we observed while we sat at the bar made me never want to step foot in this establishment again. The bartender was arguing with a young waitress about food that was sitting in the kitchen. Her response, \""I didn't know where it went so I left it there.\"" The place is small, I'm sure she could have figured it out. There was another girl working that must have been her buddy. The bartender, who I assume was in charge, was getting on them (probably for being worthless). They were rolling their eyes when he looked away and had bad attitudes. While sitting at the bar, we watched at least ten customers have to come up and order their drink. While the waitresses stood talking and complaining. \n\nI told my husband, \""If I owned this place and saw the slow, poor service, along with how many customers had to go to the bar for service, I would be embarrassed!\"" Come to find out, the owner had been sitting behind us the entire night. It amazes me how he could be in his own restaurant and be completely oblivious to the poor customer service. \n\nI would much rather go out of my way and go to Four Peaks. Maybe one day Papago Brewery will hire a pleasant, efficient wait staff.",negative,en

"I love the Biltmore's lobby, the Rendezvous Court, and Smeraldi's Restaurant. The Old World murals, gorgeous high ceilings with artistic wood and plaster work, and the traditional furnishings qualify this downtown Los Angeles gem as one of the world's great historic hotels.
Having said that, I'm not sure I would stay there again. The night I checked in I couldn't make the TV work and called reception. They said they'd sent an engineer, but then called back to say it was the cable company's fault and they couldn't do anything about it. They were waiting for the cable company's visit ""tomorrow.""
I also noticed some fairly obvious deferred maintainance in the room. For instance, the ornamental drape over the bed was held together by a plastic twist tie because the bracket intended for this purpose was broken. I also learned that none of the rooms in the hotel come with mini-fridges, and the in-room safe was useless because it was located on a high shelf in the closet that I could barely reach. The hotel does not have a spa, but does have a fitness center and an indoor pool.
I should also mention that my room was on the more expensive Club Floor, but learned that the Club Lounge closes for several hours during the day and at 8pm every night. The staff in the Lounge were not helpful in anyway. The lounge offers one computer with Internet access, continental breakfast, and evening hors d'oevres.
I mentioned to two different staff members that my room lacked a robe, slippers, and coffee maker and both of them told me to ""call housekeeping."" I've traveled enough to know that in a hotel with an attentive staff, they would have taken care of it themselves.
Valet parking is $40 a day, which seems excessive, but really it was the staff attitude and the deferred maintainance that bothered me the most. Anyone who decides to stay here should know that room sizes vary widely. I saw a ""standard room"" on a lower floor that was twice the size of mine on the Club Floor (although it had the same small bathroom). I recommend specifying at the time of booking that you'd like one of the spacious rooms - whether Club Floor or Standard.
The beds were very comfortable and the bed linens were high quality. The location is also convenient for attending events at the Walt Disney Concert Hall and the Music Centre. I'm just sorry that staff attitude was so poor.
I wouldn't recommend the hotel to a friend for an overnight stay, but will continue to keep it on my list of must-see places in L. A. and no doubt will return for a meal or afternoon tea.",positive,en

"The room was ok, clean and comfortable and also $370 for the cheapest one. Looks like a 1 bedroom luxury apt, however, you touch anything in that room and there goes at least $30 from your card, even if it's just a bottle of water and even if you tell them not to charge you before they make a contact. So, one minus there.

Well, I'm 32 and I'm an IT professional. You'd figure, a guy like me can figure out the whole navigations system in BMW 6 series in less than 10 minutes, but here I'm trying to figure out how to turn on the hot water. So I gave up after almost a minute of freezing my but there.
Second minus.
Now I'm trying to reach them to figure out why did they charge me $50 for, and naturally, you won't get live person. You have to leave a message. Nice try. People usually give up when they have to leave a message for something like this. Well, not me.

My favourite dish is the meatballs and mash potatoes and dessert goes to their apple strudel.

"My daughter and I stayed for one night on a recent trip to visit Northeastern. In reading the reviews, I asked for a room on the back side of the hotel to avoid the noise of Huntington Ave. That was request was met, but the hotel overall is very noisy with thin walls and doors. As we were settling in we could hear a couple of little kids next door clearly singing ""Take Me Out to the Ball Game"", and then heard the front desk staff knocking on someone's door at 3am. There were a couple of busloads of what looked like middle-school aged kids who were staying at the hotel, but mercifully, they were on the other side of the hotel.
The room was large, beds comfy, and bathroom clean with a good shower. Coffee maker in the room was good too. Parking convenient and relatively inexpensive for Boston.
So, while the location and rate were great, I'm not sure I'd risk staying again for fear that we might have more noisy neighbors than we had this time around. I noticed on their ""welcome board"" that they had several school groups coming - so perhaps worth checking before you book.",neutral,en

There is a Safeway right across the street, which made things very convenient to buy microwavable dinners and having an affordable meal.

The rooms division manager and operations manager were both very friendly and accommodating but moving one from a dirty room to the next dirty room does unfortunately not solve the real problem does it?

The entire experience is a sad one. A typical case of how much money can we milk out of this building without providing any service and the bare bone essentials.

"I also booked this hotel based on previous reviews. Either the reviewers have different standards, or management went downhill since. The room was filthy. Hair on the sheets and the sink. Mold in the bathroom. The pull out bed was so filthy (crumbs, peanuts, pieces of tortilla chips...) that we gave up on it, also because the mattress was thinner than the pillows. How is someone supposed to sleep on that mattress? Beats me. We ended up using an air mattress we had in the car.
Service was below average. The young woman who checked me was not even listening to my questions, the man who checked me out seemed not to know what he was doing. Only one woman seemed to have a notion of ""customer service,"" and was prompt and helpful when our room key stopped working.
The water pressure was adequate, but the shower curtain is wafer thin and it's easy to flood the bathroom floor. The bathroom door did not lock.
Last but not least, the boors above. A family with kids whose parents apparently did not believe in controlling the little lovelies, who as a result screamed and stomped most of the night. I cannot blame the hotel for the rudeness of certain American families, but be forewarned that this is the crowd that hangs out at Best Western. Needless to say, we will NOT be back.",negative,en

"Met friends on a Saturday evening after seeing a show at the Benedum.\n\nInterior was nice, exposed brick walls, deep red walls, pictures of NOLA, fleur de lis, Seated right away.\n\nFried Green Tomatoes. Looking at the menu description now, I realize I should have figured out these would be deep fried because the description says 'abita batter' but at the time, I was very disappointed because in my experience, fried green tomatoes are not dipped in batter and deep fried. They are coated in bread crumbs/cornmeal/flour and fried in some oil/bacon fat/butter in a skillet. I've always had breaded fried tomatoes, not battered & deep fried. I thought this dish was just OK, kind of disappointing. I am still so very much in love with fried green tomatoes after our honeymoon in the south and I get very excited when I see them on a menu, but these were a letdown for me. Plus, they were incredibly filling. I didn't have much room for my meal.\n\nCrispy Fried Alligator: I didn't try any. Two in our group had the alligator bites and enjoyed them, but they both noted that pretty much anything would taste good coasted in the slightly spicy breading and deep fried the served with the spicy aioli. \n\nCrab Bisque: I expected a light pink kind of color, not this dark red-brown color. G liked it, said it was spicier (more heat) than he expected, it was good, but that overall, he prefers the creamier, lighter colored versions. \n\nSeafood Jambalaya: G liked it but didn't love it. The scallops were cooked nicely, but the chicken was dry and tough. \n\nShrimp & Grits: I didn't really like this version. There were only seven shrimp and they were not especially large shrimp.There were a lot of bacon bits. The grits were nice and creamy. But I could swear our server mentioned that the barbecue like sauce was more sweet than hot and while I am a spice wimp, I found there to be just too much heat for my liking. I drank all my iced tea and some water, which rarely if ever happens, and when it does, it's because something is too hot for me or too salty. \n\nBeignets: They are very liberally coated in powdered sugar. That means I ended up covered in powdered sugar, even after shaking a bunch of it off. They also were served with three scoops of ice cream (coffee, cherry, and carrot). I don't know if I was just too full or if I found the beignets a bit bland or a bit heavy, but I ended up enjoying the ice cream much more than the beignets. Except for that carrot ice cream - interesting idea and I could taste a bit of cinnamon, I think, in the tiny taste I tried, but overall not a flavor I would suggest. The coffee ice cream was my favorite and everyone else thought the cherry was the best. \n\nOf the four of us, three of us had never before dined at NOLA. I had the impression from a previous restaurant conversation that the person who had dined there before thought it was just OK but was willing to return so the rest of us could try it. After dining there, I can see why that person thought it was just OK.\n\nWhile we were seated right away, a few minutes before our 5:45 pm reservation, it took a while for our server to make an appearance and we did not get out of there until 8 pm. R&S had to ask for their check when dessert was served to make sure they had enough time to get to the show at 8 pm. They rushed through dessert and left while we lingered a bit over dessert. Maybe it was poor planning on our part, but we were surprised at the pace of the service. \n\nOur server was fine. He offered lots of suggestions/opinions on several menu options. I thought that was nice, although it seemed to take quite a while, and others felt it was too much and unnecessary.\n\nNothing was glaringly awful, well maybe the slow service which was kind of annoying, the food was all just sort of fine or kind of disappointing, but for what we spent ($100+ after tax & tip, no alcohol) it was very disappointing. We can easily name other places where we like the food more and will spend less, and so for that reason, I have to say I doubt we will ever return, but it's possible after we exhaust the other post-show dining options and see where everything rates, but with only two shows left and us not sure if we will renew for the next season...",negative,en

"While I appreciate the addition of a sushi restaurant out here in Goodyear, I must say that I'd just rather drive to Westgate and eat at Be Sushi if I want sushi. \n\nMy husband and I dropped in for a quick dinner the other day before grocery shopping. He can't eat much fish at all, so he ordered some gyoza and a tempura shrimp roll. He enjoyed his food, but I tasted the gyoza and it was more deep fried than pan fried, which I did not like. \n\nI had the spicy tuna roll and the veggie tempura. The tuna roll was fine - not bad, but not notably good. The tempura was good, and I was surprised (and pleased) to find eggplant among the veggie-ness.\n\nThe water they served us was horrendous. I generally just like water with sushi, unless I am drinking a beer (which I wasn't in the mood for that night). I had to order an iced-tea to get the horrible taste of the water out of my mouth.\n\nThe only other criticism I have for the place is that their servingware looks like, well, hand-me-downs. I kept thinking, 'Didn't this place just recently open?' It had that \""hole-in-the-wall\"" feel inside that is only quaint to me when the place A) has been around forever and B) is the most delicious thing ever. \n\nSo, to quote Yelp, \""Meh.

It is a bit of a maze, but this makes the property very fun to explore and if you are stair adverse you can easily navigate the property by elevator. We stayed in building 6 in room #641 top floor at the end of the building, nice size room. The room was dated but the bed was comfortable. Microwave, refrigerator and coffee maker are nice amenities. There was a sitting area with a chair and a small, uncomfortable couch. The carpet at minimum could use a good cleaning, but the rooms really need updating. If you only plan on using the room to crash after a great day of sightseeing this hotel is perfect.",negative,en

"This is by far my favorite buffet place in town. The other legendary buffet places were no longer in service when I moved here some time ago. But I am happy we have the Journey Sushi now =)\n\nOther reviews have pointed out specifically the pricing and types of food available down to every detail. So I thought I'd list down a couple of my favorites. Coming from Asia, I have tried many different types of food, and I mean A LOT. Which was why I was pleasantly surprised to see that they have raw oysters and shrimps on ice. And sashimi platter too. I remember seeing salmon, tuna, hibachi, octopus sashimi to name a few. The baby clams, crabs and lobsters are really good too. \n\nBy now it is pretty apparent I am a huge seafood fan. But in addition, I also love their tepanyaki (stir-fry) bar. You get to choose the items you like and the chef will stir-fry them for you on the spot. On certain days you get marinated beef ribs at the bar, which are awesome. \n\nThe popular items do go very fast, so keep an eye for your favorites and get it fast, otherwise it will take a while before they re-stock, especially on busy times of the day.\nThey do have a large seating area with an additional room, so definitely the place to go if you have a large group. Great for gatherings and such. \n\nThe location is out on the East side, not the most convenient for me who lives out on the West side and work on campus. But it's great selection of food and good quality draw me here regardless so that says quite a lot about the place =)",neutral,en

Room was immpeccably clean and had a very large bed. There were nice finishing touches which included egyptian cotton sheets and chocolates on the pillow every evening. Room was well equipped with fully stocked mini bar and nice toiletries in the bathroom.
Hotel facilities were also very good. Dinner in the restaurant was nice but a little overpriced for what we got. The roof top bar is just fantastic with an amazing view of the Empire State Building - this is a must after a long day sightseeing or shopping.

I did not have to wait long in line. As soon as I walked in I was greeted and directed to the area where my movie was playing. Before I went in I grabbed some goodies from the snack bar. The snack bar was well staffed with friendly employees. My popcorn was fresh and my beverage was a nice cool drink. The condiment table was filled with popcorn toppings, butter, salt, pepper, napkins and other goodies to go with food ordered. This area was clean. The room I saw my movie in was clean as well. The floors were swept with no trash anywhere in sight. The room temperature was perfect and the sound quality was nice. The theater was cozy. I am happy that I gave this location a try.",neutral,en

"I LOVE the Aria and especially the guest rooms! The best features of the gorgeous rooms include:\n\n- most comfortable bed I have ever slept in with the most amazing pillows too; I really need to call the hotel to ask them where I can buy my own!\n- great technology that allowed us to control all the lights, and the curtains, and the room temperature, music, and even the \""do not disturb\"" light from a touch screen remote beside the bed\n- coolest shower/bath set-up ever - the bath tub was within the big square glass shower which was fun to play in and create an \""infinity bath!\""\n- when we ordered champagne to our room, they also suggested chocolate covered strawberries which were delicious!\n\nAlso, the hotels restaurants were great. There are lots of super options though they are a little pricey. We loved Jean Georges, the Patisserie, and Lemongrass (basically everywhere we tried!) and the others all looked good too.\n\nThe colors of the casino are a bit gloomy with a lot of brown and the fact that the Craps table took a lot of money from us made it feel even gloomier. The dealers did not seem to be Vegas's \""A Team\"" either... I'd rather go elsewhere to gamble but here to stay!!!\n\nThe entrance and waterfall are gorgeous too - you should check out City Center even if you are not staying there!",positive,en

"We had low expectations to this hotel, all we wanted was a place to sleep and shower between our hectic schedule, we only had a couple of days in NYC.

Except from that, we enjoyed our stay in this hotel. The staff was helpful, and our room was cleaned every day. When we needed another blanket, we got it right away. There was a little smell in the room, but it didn't bother us.

Starters crabcakes must of been out of freezer since it took like 5 minutes from the order to get in the table and it tasted like chicken nuggets.. Main course, chicken and cashew nuts, did not taste like anything, not spicy or nothing and vegetables were too raw. In the beginning when we asked for water for the drink with out beers the waitress first forgot then and then when I asked again he brought us tap water in a glass. We had to ask if it was tap water and he said yes and asked then if we wanted bottled water.

I couldn't even watch 30 minutes of this crap, I didn't laugh, chuckle, or even smirk at this movie, actually the only time I smirked was when I saw how horrid this movie was. I could not believe how hard he tried to make the viewers laugh in this movie...and it didn't work once. Although from seeing the horribly awful camera angles and hearing the disgusting script I realized why I had never heard of this movie,...because it sucks more than anything has ever sucked before.

"I chose this hotel purely based on the Tripadvisor reviews, and I'm so glad I did! It made our 8th Anniversary Trip perfect.
This is one of the best hotel experiences we've had in a long, long time. The lobby and room were beautiful. The staff were always friendly and accomodating, from the front desk to valet parkers to food servers. All were so nice! The breakfast buffet (included in room) was great (eggs, sausage, biscuts, cereal, pastries, fruit, you name it). The location was fantastic.
Our room had a king bed with jacuzzi tub for two. It was spotlessly clean, nicely decorated, had free wi-fi access, a 37"" LCD tv, great A/C which you control, a huge jacuzzi tub which we loved, a stall shower, everything you could need. You can request an extra hour at check-out, which we did, for free. Our cool old fashioned looking bank door was awesome as well. We also never heard noise from other rooms. I couldn't not find a single fault with the room, and I'm picky about things! We loved the view from our 19th floor room (as well as the views from the observation deck and pool deck.)
There are two pools, both with jacuzzis. One indoor and one outdoor on the roof. If I were forced to find something wrong, the pools were on the smaller size. But, if having a huge pool was your priority, you probably wouldn't book anywhere in the Riverwalk area anyway. It was so nice to cool down in the roof top pool after a long hot day of walking.

"When arriving at Holiday Inn we pulled up in the drive way and waited about 10 minutes to finally figure out that they don't offer valet service. You have to check in first so you can get a parking stub. The room was standard but nice to have a option of ""firm"" or ""soft"" pillows. They do offer Bath & Body Works toiletries instead of the cheapy stuff. The room 1703 has a view of Van Ness. The bathroom itself is very basic and needs a remodel. The baggage clerk downstairs was nice and gave us help with accessing the nearest bus stop and telling us alternative routes to getting to Pier 39/Fisherman's Wharf. The 47 bus is the cheapest at $2 per passenger. The room was basic with no frills but a plus is that is was quiet on that floor. I would prefer something a bit nicer but it is easy access to the Opera and Govt. buildings",neutral,en

"My husband, son and I spent a week at this resort (8/25/2012 - 8/31/2012). Our room had a wonderful garden and bay view but upon check in we noticed that the security locks on the door entering the room and the door connecting to the room next door were both broken. The sliding door to the balcony was difficult to open. I called the front desk to let them know that I did not feel very secure staying in a room with two broken security locks. The front desk offered to switch our room or to send someone to repair the locks. We opted for the second choice as we really liked the view. A nice gentleman showed up about an hour later . . .he replaced the lock on the door to the adjoining room and tightened the lock on the outer door. He also attempted to fix the sliding door (slight improvement but not great ...)
We did wonder what happened in this room prior to our visit . . . did someone try to break into the room (while someone was in the room with the security lock on) ? was there a fight between guests staying in the connecting rooms?
Our room was quite clean, however, our balcony was dirty, paint was peeling, and there was bird poop on the railing. The balcony was a very nice size but the furniture seemed inadequate compared to the size as there were only two small tall chairs and a very small tall table.
You were supposed to have to enter your room key into the entry door to our building in order to gain access but the entry door was never closed properly and when it was closed . . .it never seemed to lock. Anyone could walk into the building . . . room key or not. The entry door area had a weird smell the entire week and there was a section of the wall that looked very dirty. The hallway leading to our room had lots of very dirty windows overlooking the adult retreat area (a big turnoff!) . . . the windows were full of dirt and cobwebs. The day we checked in . . .I noticed two dirty wine glasses were sitting on the window sill in the hallway outside our door . . .it took hotel staff about 3 days before they were picked up from the window sill.
What is the deal with the parking fee? We were charged a daily parking fee . . .however it seemed that anyone not staying at the hotel could have parked in the hotel parking lot for free as no one ever checked to see if cars had a parking permit. (Charge your guests to park but allow anyone else to park for free ??? ) If you are going to charge for parking . .. you should check cars for parking permits!! Many evenings . . .we had trouble finding a parking spot near our building.
Pool area was very nice but with had to wonder how clean the pool water was as we saw paper napkins floating in the pool and about a half dozen ducks swimming in the pool. Ordered two Pina Coladas from the bar (Alfresco's) and they were terrible (tasted like a water slushy with a dash of rum, pineapple and coconut). I felt bad for the bartender as it was very obvious that he was overwhelmed as it seemed that he was the only bartender to handle the holiday weekend crowd. (You would think a Hilton would have planned better !)
We enjoyed the coffee shop (oatmeal, bear claws and coffee for breakfast). We also enjoyed breakfast at Aqua. We chose to eat dinner at Aqua our last night for the convenience. Dinner was overpriced. My son had the pork chops which were very good. I had the chicken and my husband had the steak which were just okay. We did enjoy the live singer/guitar player during our dinner.
We enjoyed the dive in movie night (complimentary popcorn was a nice touch!). We also enjoyed family smore's night on the beach (the singers/guitar player was also really nice touch!)

"Everything you are looking for in a decent park!\n\nThe layout of this place is a good design. On one end you have a big parking lot. This section is where the kids playground and some covered areas complete with tables, benches, and barbeque grills. Also there is a large soccer field and tennis court as well, not ti mention several basketball courts.\n\nIn the middle of the park you have a single stand up building for your restrooms which I gotta say when I used it that it was nice and clean. \n\nJust past that are a couple of baseball fields that are nicely maintained. Also there is another parking lot next to that as well so you don't have park on the other side and don't have to walk as far.\n\nAll through out the park there are benches and drinking fountains which to me means a lot especially on those hot triple digit summer days. The paths are nice and wide enough for joggers, bikers, and for walking your dog.",positive,en

"Mỗi phần của cuốn sách đều được bắt đầu bằng những câu chuyện do Đại đức từng trải qua.

Có lẽ đến đây nhiều bạn sẽ thắc mắc sống hiền lành cũng là một điều sai sao? Sống hiền không sai nhưng sống mà cứ thuận theo ý kiến người khác để vừa lòng họ, không dám nói lên ý kiến của mình, kìm nén cảm xúc của mình để rồi đôi khi ta cảm thấy oan ức, khốn khổ và tự công kích chính bản thân mình. Để thay đổi, chúng ta cần phải sống hiền lành với bản thân mình trước khi hiền lành với người khác, đừng ngần ngại bộc lộ suy nghĩ và cảm xúc của mình với đối phương, đừng sợ việc đó sẽ khiến đối phương ghét bạn vì có lẽ họ cũng muốn biết cảm nhận của bạn là như thế nào đấy.",positive,vi

"I cannot believe I haven't reviewed this place! I have been here a handful of times and each time it has been consistently good. My favorite item is the 24 K curry, which is a spicy green curry that features some delicious veggies (japanese eggplant that is melt in your mouth (probably the best eggplant I've ever had... I don't typically like eggplant), squash, and green beans). I usually add chicken and have more than enough food for two meals. Wild Thaiger has decent specials on some nights of the week for drinks (Mondays feature 5$ martinis). My only complaint about the Thaiger is that, unlike other Thai restaurants, they do not allow you to choose your spiciness level. I understand that some dishes may be better spicy or mild, but I would like to have the option available. I would say that Wild Thaiger is the best Thai food I have had in the downtown area and would recommend it.",neutral,en

"As a child, I spent my summers in NYC, and now as an adult, I go back every chance I get. This was the fisrt time I had stayed in this hotel, and it exeeded my expectations. i went up for new years and stayed with a good freind on the 31st, then we went here for the 1st. The hotel was easy to find and right in midtown. The building is beatifull, and I like how simplistic the decor was. I had more guests then originally planned, and wanted to pay for extra cots, but they upgraded our room with no addtuional charge. As a college student paying out of pocket, this was a big deal! We were given our key, and took the elavator to our room, where we found 2 queen sized beds, a medium sized bathroom, a large flat screen tv, and ample space to put away our belongings. The room was very clean, and smelled like fresh laundry. The beds were so comfy, I slept like a baby! There was plenty of towels/shampoo/conditioner/soap. They provide Aveda products, so they don't give you the cheap stuff. At check out(after forcing ourselves out of those comfy beds) we were able to check in our bags free of charge to pick up that day so we did not have to lug them around town with us. They provide coffee and hot chocolate and tea for free in the lobby. I was hoping they had the New York Tiems available, but they had the New York post, possibly thier only flaw. The service was great. The staff was extremely helpfull and freindly. We got free biscotti with our cofee while talking with one of the staff members about New Years, and it was good. I will definatley reccomend this to anyone on a budget. I look forward to going back in June. Happy new year!",positive,en

(Mild spoilers) My heart is so full after reading this book. Johan is utterly sweet, and I love the way he takes responsibility for his mistakes and refuses to let Nya placate him. Nya's relationship with her father is heartwrenching. The book clearly shows how his lies and manipulation have had a lasting effect on her. Johan of course isn't fooling anybody with his pretense that he doesn't have feelings for Nya. He keeps telling her ""as you wish"" in his native tongue, and we all know what that means. Then there's Lukas. Non-binary heir to the throne, trying to find their place in the world.

"Like most on here I too was apprehensive about my stay at the Roosevelt. I'm pleased to say, that in part, my apprehensions did not fully come to fruition. As ever I'll start with the positives. The lobby, bar area and all other communal areas of the hotel were immaculate and the 1930s decor was stunning in my opinion, here the hotel is befitting of it's mantra ""the grand old dame"". Clearly the makers of Gossip Girl agreed, they were filming at the hotel during my stay. The food was good too, my steak earned it's $25 price tag I'd say. The maid service was excellent, each day I returned to my room to find my bed made with fresh towels in the bathroom, the cleaning it's self was to high standard with all the debrief from my previous day's exploits in and around Manhattan readily taken care of. The location of the hotel is another positive, if you want to walk or take the Subway most of the key attractions of this great city are within easy reach of the Roosevelt. Now about the room, 852, it was clean, a good size and contained two comfortable double beds. However, it is true to say that there were some noticeable minor aesthetic defects though certainly not enough to warrant any great concern, the bathroom however, whilst being clean and fully functional was in need of refurbishment. Small pockets of mold had developed around the bath with the some of the enamel worn away on the bath it's self. In all the bathroom had a rather dated feel to it though I should stress that this again is no great cause for concern. We are talking minor defects here, similar to those I've encountered in 4 and 5 star hotels. My experience of the hotel bar was over all a little less then satisfactory, service was slow, here I do not blame the bar staff, the fact is on the nights in question there simply wasn't enough staff on to cope with demand. In all certainly not the horror hotel some would have you believe, I enjoyed my stay and would happily return. A solid 3 star hotel that has the potential to strive for better things. If you're thinking of staying at the Roosevelt I have some advice for you. 1) Don't pay $14 per day for Internet access. Every Starbucks and McDonald's in Manhattan provides free wireless Internet access, simply accept the terms and conditions and you're online. There is at least three Starbucks and one McDonald's with two minutes walk of the hotel. 2) If you're a Steak fan you must visit Morton's Steak House, a minutes walk away on the same street (45th Street) Morton's provides probably the best Steak in the world, I cannot describe how good this restaurant is. If you have the cash to spare, it is pricey, you must go. 3) Visit the Highline. The Highline is an old elevated rail road that snakes it's way throughout the lower middle half of Manhattan and beyond. Long since disused it has been converted into public gardens with much of the old rail infrastructure left in place, it truly is a unique, beautiful public space that provides great views of the city and a great place to unwind. Entrance can be found on 23rd Street, and the best part, it's completely free. 4) For breakfast lunch or dinner try the New York Luncheonette, situated on 50th Street close to the junction with 3rd Avenue it's about a five minute walk from the hotel. The locals love it and so will you.",neutral,en
"Great location, great price! The hotel is one of the closest to the airport and it's right in the middle of the action. The beds are comfortable and you can spend a bit more for a larger room with two sinks and a large soaker tub and separate shower. Internet is a bit pricey at $13.99/day. \n\nThere is a shopping mall attached complete with two ABC Liquor/Convenience stores (reasonably priced) as well as H&M, Bath and Body Works, and a few less expensive dining options. The restaurants in the hotel itself are good, however they're not the most affordable. This is common among the luxury hotels on the strip.",neutral,en

"First of all sorry for my English that is not very good. I and my wife went to a trip to west USA and Canada for 37 days. In this wonderful trip we accommodated 27 hotels and motels, three of them were booked in advance by our travel agent. For the Renoir hotel we paid for 3 nights $450. I am sorry to state that Renoir hotel was the worst of all the hotels we have been at.
As many travelers mentioned there are many homeless people near the hotel. Not very pleasant but bearable.
The real bad thing was the room. A very little dense room with 2 single narrow beds with very hard mattresses. There was only one ramshackle chair in the room, it was dangerous to sit on it. Room without air conditioner and without possibility to open a window. Tiny, old bathroom disgusting to enter. Lack a toilet paper and only one towel for each of us. We asked on possibility of connection to Internet and were told that there are two positions in the lobby by payment. We agreed to pay but all our efforts and the reception staff to connect did not succeed. Concerning the parking, it is acceptable to pay about $30 for one day and we agreed to pay it.
Since the room was so terrible and Although we already paid $450 (plus tax), we had no choice but to search another hotel, and indeed very soon we found an excellent hotel not very far away from the Renoir hotel in a calm and pleasant environment. We returned to hotel Renoir and requested not to charge us for the half hour in which the car parked in the parking lot. The reception clerk tried to credit us but since he didn't know how to do it, he phoned the manager of the hotel that explained him how to do it. We were promised that we will not be debited for the half hour (time of the parking for that day).
When arriving back to our country we were surprised to find that our visa account was debited despite the promise.
To conclude, my recommendation is not to stay in this hotel.",negative,en

The entertainment system is fantastic, and you get to watch it on a beautifully large screen, and have the use of a console to control the screen.
All the food provided was the best I've had on a plane, the flight attendants keep your glass topped up whenever you ask for a refill, and make sure you are well hydrated.

"Short version: every health care professional in the country should be required to tour this place to see how it's done.\n\nLong version: Facing a possible serious health condition I grew tired of waiting for my primary to refer me to a specialist and called Mayo. They accepted my insurance (United Healthcare) and scheduled an appt within a week.\n\nLeading up to my appointment I received 3 calls - preregistration they call it - each designed to make my first visit as fast and easy as possible.\n\nFor my first appt they actually had me in early. I had a lengthy discussion with a cardiologist named Dr. Click, who was professional, knowledgeable, genuinely interested and in no rush to just get me in and out. He scheduled three more appointments and within 15 minutes I had a printed itinerary. The first was bloodwork. Down one floor where I waited less than 15 minutes before I was in and done. The 2nd and 3rd were two days later and again I was admitted early.\n\nEvery single person I encountered there (10+) was pleasant and professional. Each confirmed my name and birth date to make sure I was who they thought I was...comforting to say the least.\n\nAfter all of the tests were done I met with the cardiologist again and he went to great lengths to explain every detail to me, answer my questions and give his advice. At no point did I feel rushed or like I was just a number (or a payment on a summer home.)\n\nThe facility is about an hour from Central Phoenix but well worth the drive. For out-of-towners they have a hotel next door. I'd highly recommend Mayo to anyone and would probably fly family members out the next time the need arises.",positive,en

"Here is what disappointed me about the Austin Hilton: Small room, dowdy furniture (more like a Holiday Inn along the highway), small bathroom, extra fee for internet service in the room, very small space in hotel lobby to access free wireless internet service, fee for using exercise room (although, I admit, I didn't have to pay because I am a member of Hilton Honors with silver status). For the price I paid, the value was just not there. To be fair, not all was bad. The mattress was very comfortable and the room was kept clean. I also did not hear much hallway noise. There is a very nice cafe in the lobby (Starbucks type, but not a Starbucks although the coffee is Starbucks) with a very nice atmosphere. The location is fine for downtown business travelers, or, if you are so inclined to want to go to a lot of bars on 6th St. I guess my biggest gripe is the value for the money.

"I saw Bandit Queen in 2005, over a decade after it was made amidst widespread controversy in India. The language, the stark treatment and the natural acting (by a relatively unknown cast for that time) might have been even more shocking at that time for an Indian populace more familiar with fantasy cinema. The film, the cast, and Shekhar Kapoor, deserve accolades for the breakthrough effort.The plot is not very different from a typical revenge drama made in various forms in India. In fact, there have been several fictional accounts of this particular story itself. The reason why this stands out is that it's supposed to be a first person account of someone who actually went through all this, and a lot else that doesn't find place on the screen, and survived to tell the tale. Survived long enough to see her story made into a movie at least. Phoolan Devi didn't live very long after being released from prison in 1994.The film scores on several counts. The cinematography is brilliant. The music is apt. The cast, many of whom became more familiar names later, is very good. But the screenplay is patchy. Things move too fast and in jerks at times. It's understandable though, because there are just too many strands that need to be tied together to make it all cohesive. Or maybe I felt that because I have read Mala Sen's book, which is a more detailed and better, though obviously not as shocking as the visual, account of Phoolan Devi's travails, and which is purported to be one of the main sources for the film.There are some factual ambiguities too. According to Phoolan Devi, she wasn't present when the Behmai massacre took place, and despite claiming to be the dictated account of Phoolan herself, she is shown to participate, and in fact initiate, the massacre. Then the final scene where Phoolan surrenders shows her touching the feet of the Chief Minister, while in reality she had surrendered to a portrait of Mahatma Gandhi. Symbolic value only, but shows that Phoolan didn't want to show servitude to a living, ordinary person. It would have been nice to show the Chief Minister to have some resemblance to Arjun Singh, who many remember was the CM of Madhya Pradesh then.But these are small chinks in this eminently well-made movie, a rare gem to come out from the mainstream Indian film industry, made by a man who before this was known best for the ultimate masala movie of the late 80s - Mr India.",positive,en

"The Allerton's only advantage; LOCATION. It is central to everything and smack dab in the middle of all the hustle and bustle of Michigan Ave. I've stayed here several times and find it average on all accounts. Just love the location; dont expect much from this hotel.
Until my recent experience, I had never encountered problems with this hotel.
The woman, who checked us in one evening, was very rude and did not offer any room upgrade alternatives (i.e., upgrading to a king suite) to accomodate 3 adults when I discussed my initial needs. Instead, she was standoffish, short, and unhelpful, providing us with keys to room that did not fit our needs with helping to identify a fitting solution. Upon walking into the room, we realized how small it was and called down to the front desk to ask for other options from another woman, which the woman in the beginning should have suggested to us before hauling all of our luggage upstairs and having to come back down. I was glad we got to upgrade for an additional $35/night, which is no problem. My other complaints was that Valet service was not available when I arrived and we had to double-park and go inside to get somebody to assist us. The elevators are also very small.
I have been charged an additional fees on my debit card; I have called the front desk and been fowarded to the accounting center several times where I have left only 2 voicemails requesting that someone call me back. I am dissapointed and frustrated with the level of service provided by this hotel, beginning from check-in to even after the hotel stay- which I am still dealing with a week after my check-out date. No one has contacted me from the hotel yet.
For the level of dissatisfaction I have experienced, I do not plan to use this hotel in the future and nor will I recommend it to anyone else.",negative,en

"It deeply disturbs me that Subway has become the go-to sub shop around the states. Apparently when the oil shortage started there was also a cold cuts bandit that held Subway hostage and now you're only allowed 3 slices of meat on your mediocre roll and if you'd like the blandness toasted, they can do that now too, oh joy. \n\nI would vote for Capriotti's to take over all Subways but I'd most likely gain 20 pounds from eating a sub everyday for the rest of my life. A foot long a day would make any girl happy.\n\nCapriotti's prides itself on freshness, slow cooking and hand pulling their turkey and roast beef at the shop. The three sammys I suggest and love are the grilled italian, the cheese steak, and the signature bobbie. The first 2 are pretty self explanatory, loaded with tons of meat, cheese and veggies and beyond scrumptious. The bobbie however is specific to them and is made of homemade turkey, cranberry sauce, stuffing and mayo. Your first bobbie will have your taste buds dancing and when you stare that sub down like Joey on Friends you'll never be the same. Every Subway you pass from that moment on will look like the talentless redheaded stepchild of the sub world.\n\nJust in case you still don't believe me, check out the awards for these hand held wonders: \n <url> They.

"Oh my goodness. This was a real big mess that just couldn't help itself. Jeffrey (Jon Heder) is a 29 year old man still living with his mum (Diane Keaton) and not planning on going anywhere. Until his mother meets a rich businessman named Mert (Jeff Daniels) who she may be getting married to.It would have been an OK movie if Heder didn't play his Jeffrey so annoying, from the very start there is no chance of liking him and it only gets worse and worse. In the end, we are supposed to like him, but there was no reason to as he hadn't changed from the selfish brute that he was at the beginning of the movie.Keaton doesn't look to even be trying and is in horrible form after 2007's Because I Said So. Not to mention the shocking chemistry between Heder and Keaton, and where supposed to believe that their mother and son? The only saving grace is Jeff Daniels and Anna Faris although they don't look very interested either. Apart from a few little smiles, this film really doesn't deserve to be called a comedy simply because there is barely anything to laugh at!

"Viva Las Vegas! I was in Sin City for a business convention. I was there for business, but I managed to have a lot of fun along the way. I LOVE to gamble! A lot of my associates were staying at cheaper hotels, but I don't settle for second best. I enjoy the thrill of gambling. A little too much, hahaha... I really love to bet on sports and for my money (literally), Mandalay Bay has the best sports book in Vegas. My wife (now ex-wife) and I once stayed at MB a year after it opened. It has changed a lot, but it's still just as good as it was then. \n\nI had just a bit of trouble at check-in. The room was not ready on time, so I hung around the casino for a while and ended up losing around $1500 . That is a lot of coin to lose while waiting for your room. It was not a huge deal. When the room was ready, the bellman was terrific in carrying my two very heavy suitcases to my room. \n\nI had a room on an upper floor. The view of the strip was spectacular. A man-made city of lights in the desert! I stared out in wonderment. I almost forgot to unpack, I was so entranced by the beauty of this mysterious city. \n\nThe bed was fit for a king. The entire room made me feel like a sultan of the desert. Nice artwork and color scheme. The bathroom looked nice, but that is where most of my problems with the room took place. I also had a small problem with the television. The first time I used the remote, it wouldn't turn on the TV. I called the front desk and they sent up a nice man to change the batteries. Turns out that there was nothing wrong with the remote. I was just holding it upside down. I felt a little silly, but the man assured me that this happens quite often. \n\nLets talk about the bathroom. A sunken bathtub, a shower stall, and a little television IN THE BATHROOM! Viewable from the throne (toilet). One night, I felt like using the bathtub. It was very relaxing. The problem was the amount of towels. I had previously asked them for extra towels. I usually need around four. I was not able to dry myself off thoroughly. I called from the bathroom and asked them to quickly send me up a few towels (I was still wet). A woman from housekeeping came by with ONE towel. There was one awkward moment when the maid handed it through the door as I tried to cover myself the best I could. \n\nThat was only one problem I encountered with the bathroom. The toilet clogged a few times throughout my stay and I even ran out of toilet paper. Both times, the maintenance staff handled the situations very respectfully. \n\nIf you love to party, you never have to leave MB. Any type of experience you desire: Asian, French, Italian, Mexican, American, and Russian. That week I ate at a bunch of great restaurants: Border Grill, Burger Bar, Charlie Palmer Steak, Citizens Kitchen & Bar, Hussong's Cantina, Bayside Buffet (twice), Noodle Shop, and Rick Moonen's RM Seafood. All great! \n\nI must also say that I have stayed at both the MGM and Luxor in the past, and MB's casino is much better. I played a lot of slots, poker, roulette, craps, etc.... It was a blast. I won some money, lost some money, and was maybe only down around 2K for the week.\n\nToward the end of my week, I booked myself some spa time at Spa Mandalay. I was putting a lot of stress on myself during the week and needed to unwind. I got deep tissue massage and found it unsatisfying. It didn't feel like my tissues were being penetrated enough. I also had a steam wrap (very nice), a Fijian Hot Stone Herbal Scrub, and a Moroccan Hot Stone Ritual (which I still don't quite understand). The whole thing was pretty nice, but I liked the steam wrap the most. \n\nThere is a ton to do and see at Mandalay Bay. The casino, restaurants, and spa were all great. (Forgot to mention the aquarium, great for kids and adults) I guess there is a club scene there as well, but I don't care for any of that. Overall, my stay was wonderful! (On the flight home, I noticed my glands were swollen. This probably didn't have anything to do with my stay)",neutral,en

"This movie is not the scariest of all time, but it is a great example of a campy eighties horror flick -- low budget, no stars, lots of inventive death scenes, and enough nudity to keep the teenagers in their seats. The premise is interesting and fun and the three evil kids play their parts well. A nice starting point for ""Just Say"" Julie Brown exposing her talents early in her career. This film won't be seen by many, but for fans of 80's horror it's a must.",positive,en

"Bette Midler is indescribable in this concert. She gives her all every time she is on stage. Whether we are laughing at her jokes and antics or dabbing our eyes at the strains of one of her tremendous ballads, Bette Midler moves her audience. If you can't see it live (which is the best way to see Bette) then this is the next best thing. An interesting thing to look at is how incredible her voice has changed and matured over the years but never lost its power. Her more ""vocally correct"" version of ""Stay With Me"" never loses anything in spirit from THE ROSE or DIVINE MADNESS, Here it is just more pure and as heartfelt as ever. I will treasure this concert for a very long time.",positive,en

"I gave this film an 10/10 with some reluctance as it's hard to praise something that so haunted and terrified me for years. The sheer menace on the woman in black's face is just pure horror and the accompanying music just worsens the dread. I saw this when it was first on TV when I was 10 and it really did disturb me for years. I'm fascinated by the fact that so many other users have said this too. So many movie reviews go on about how disturbing or terrifying a film might be but you can believe all those who have posted on this board, this really is incredibly powerful stuff. I mean I really like horror films and generally find them quite funny more often than not, but this really is menacing and will probably disturb most people. I haven't seen it since I was 10 and I'm tempted to watch it again but fear I might have some sleepless nights. I can't quite put my finger on what it is exactly, but I think it's something to do with the fact that fear is the Woman's greatest weapon and that we, as viewers, are just as susceptible as we feel the fear so intensely. It's remarkable that other viewers' feelings are so unanimous.I've also seen the stage play, which was an excellent production...but nothing can compare to this.",positive,en

We ordered chicken malai tikka, machli tikka (fish), palak paneer, began masala, kadai murg and masala jhinga. The chicken was really very nice, tender, juicy and very tasty. The fish tikka was too salty and all the curries were overlooked and seemed to be made with the same basic curry. Not very nice and certainly not the best Indian diner we have had around Kuala Lumpur. One more comment, the restaurant is a bit outdated and stuffy (a bit strange because they just renovated the place) and made worse due to the thick carpet which seems a bit unhygienic to us. Not sure if we will return (unfortunately).",negative,en

"I'm a big fan of the aloft brand from SPG because for certain types of trips it gives us exactly what we want and need and no more. I appreciate there are two desks, there is free wifi, there is a fridge in the room, there are healthy, edible snacks available on a 24/7 basis (among other things, like the exercise room and the properties that have a laundromat and the free parking at most).
This particular aloft is a little run down. The bathroom wasn't as crisp and the rooms were way too worn out for such a new property. I know it's an airport hotel and people are passing through but this is a big problem for me in many hotels in Philadelphia, not just here. The bathroom tiles in the shower had already started to settle, making it uncomfortable to stand on. The safe in our room was shut and no one noticed it. The rooms were clean enough but the public areas were not.
The beds were very comfortable, comforters adequate, pillows soft. I am there to sleep, this is important.
I would like to praise the hotel staff for good humor and attentiveness, except for the woman who was working Saturday afternoon. She was decidedly too junior and that was clear from her interactions not just with me but with others. The hotel was booked full due to three different concerts in the area and this is not the time to try out someone new.
Keep in mind that if you are traveling to Philly and stay at this hotel, you do not need a car. The free airport shuttle will connect you to the SEPTA (regional rail) at the airport, which takes you to Center City in 15 minutes. However, there is NOTHING ELSE within walking distance of the hotel, so once you're there, you're stranded if you don't have a car. There are two other SPG properties in the same complex so you could eat at their restaurants if you had to. If you do have a car, this is an excellent option for events at Citizens Bank Park, Lincoln Financial Field, or the arena in the same complex - it's less than 10 minutes' away.",negative,en

"I would stay here again but only because of the location. If the room was not clean I would ask to be moved next time.
The Good:
The location is great - close to all the attractions at or near the wharf. It is an easy walking distance to the ferries for the Alcatraz tours. The area is very safe so you can feel comfortable walking day or night. The lobby is very nice. ALL the staff were very professional and helpful. Always had a hello and a smile even in the pouring rain. There are snacks, sandwiches and drinks available in the lobby for a fairly reasonable price. The beds and pillows were very comfortable. Starbucks coffee for the room :). IHOP just down the street for a cheaper breakfast.
The Not so Good:
The buffet was expensive but I did not go beyond the door. Would take a pretty outstanding hotel buffet to be worth the price. The rooms are far from sound proof. We could CLEARLY hear the people overhead walking. Fortunately they were not up late. The worst was the lack of cleaning in the room. The bed and the counters seemed clean but the floor was very bad. The corners and baseboards were very dusty. I thought I was being picky until we went to leave and my husband checked under the bed. There were pretzels and a bottle cap - obviously had not been vacuumed in quite sometime. There were problems with the elevator and one night only one of the three was running. Parking on site would have been about $60 /day with the taxes. Across the street in the Safeway parking lot it was $30/day but you could not take your car in and out without paying more. No free Wi-Fi in the rooms - cannot figure this one out at all. The hotel across the street offered free Wi-Fi and free parking. In this day and age Wi-Fi should be free in any hotel. I personally feel this is just a gouge and the ""Shertons"" need to look at their Wi-Fi policy. You could get free Wi-Fi in the lobby.",negative,en

"I hate assigned seats at a concert venue. Especially in today's internet purchasing age where all you can do is pray to the music Gods that you are going to get a good seat. You sit patiently in front of your seat, constantly reloading a page as the internet sale begins to make sure you are right there when it starts. You request seats in what must be 10 seconds after the sale started, and the best seats you can get are in the 26th row off center. WTF do you have to do to get a set of the primo seats just fucking once?\n\nThe consolation for seated venues is that it is usually in a great outdoor amphiteater where you can kick back and enjoy your reserved space under the stars. Or its in an art-deco revival theater that is an amazing setting for a show. \n\nBut here at Dodge, there is no consolation prize. Its boxy, boring, and cold. They went to no expense whatsoever to dress up the Dodge or make it an interesting place to see a concert. Its gray, drab, and would totally put you to sleep if it didn't have an amazing soundsystem powered by some top notch acts that play here.\n\nIn addition, it has some seating that in no way, shape, or form should be sold at full price. The seats at the far left and right sections of the main area should be avoided at all costs. They are commonly as much as any other seat in the house, but are at such a sharp viewing angle that you can only see the front of the stage. I saw a Cure concert from there recently and never was able to confirm if they in fact had a drummer in the band.\n\nAnd to top it off you are likely going to have to pay hefty ticket prices at about 50-100 dollars, have about 15 dollars in fees per ticket, and have to pay 10 dollars for low quality brews.\n\nTo enjoy this place you need to REALLY want to see whoever plays here, have some good friends with you, drink heavily before the show, stay away from the seats at the far sides, show up just in time for the show, and be ready to indulge in the intense sound this place produces because there is nothing else here that is going to entertain you.",negative,en

"Awful, awful, awful! My husband & I decided to try something new in The District for our one-year anniversary. We decided on The Elephant Bar despite several friends telling us the food was terrible. I usually don't write reviews unless the business is extraordinarily amazing or awful...this place is definitely classified as awful in my book. My husband ordered a chicken/tri-tip combo plate, which didn't look anything like the picture. The chicken was marinated in some sort of sauce that tasted like the smell of dirty feet; the tri-tip was not very good either. I ordered the Misoyaki Salmon, which was very dry and the sauce was average. The veggies were soaked in oil and appeared to be the frozen kind you throw in a saucepan. My husband is not a very picky eater, but even he agreed he would never come back. We should have trusted our instincts and celebrated at the places we know are good...Lucille's, Cheesecake Factory, GVR Cafe or even Al's Garage (bar food) put this place to shame. Don't waste your time... And now I know why such a 'high class' place puts out so many coupons.

"Весьма негативное впечатление сложилось из-за навязывания питания кормом, хотя проблема совсем не в этом. Как и следовало ожидать, ветврач совершенно не сведущ в питании домашних питомцев. Чего только стоят утверждения: что из мяса кошке не получить таурин, ежедневное употребление микродозы печени вызывет переизбыток витамина А и на видотипичном питании вы посадите кошке почки🤦‍♀️несмотря на то, что по-моему всем известно, что как раз-таки на сухарях возникают проблемы с почками, мочевыводящей и половой системами. Надо было видеть реакцию, когда сказали, что на сырой натуралке кошка 4 с лишним года😂\nДа и совет попить витамины без анализов, вызывает удивление, неужели врач не знает простой истины, что переизбыток хуже недостатка. Когда я на это указала, ветврач быстро съехала с темы, начав фразу: ""ну всё равно.."". Кстати этим советом она сама себе противоречила, ведь до этого говорила про переизбыток витамина А🙄\nВ целом, понаблюдав со стороны, назначения для других пациентов, могу с уверенностью сказать, что немало лишнего и лишь бы что подороже. Кстати, назначают симпарику, интересно, предупреждают ли, что в случае индивидуальной реакции антидота нет🤔\nВ остальном приём понравился, вызвали по времени, к которому записались. Времени уделили много. Проблему разобрали по полочкам, от и до в самых мелких деталях.\nМы в процессе лечения, посмотрим, каков будет результат.\n\nUPD Да, конечно я лучше разбираюсь как кормить мою кошку. За 8,5 лет её жизни уже всё изучено, переизучено и пробовано и перепробовано.\nНе передёргивайте, смешны же. Лучше бы вы это инфу по поводу витаминов-БАДов на приёме говорили, а не пытались впарить!\nСпасибо, что разрешили, кормить мою кошку, как я считаю правильным.\nВот это конечно ""сильный"" аргумент про весь цивилизованный мир. Давайте тогда ещё может обсудим, почему многие врачи неправильно питаются и жиреют, особенно диетологи. Или например, то, что огромное количество людей наркозависимые. Следуя вашей логике, почему бы не пойти по их стопам, ведь их же тоже много, разве они не правы..\nКрайне ""профессиональный"" совет почитать в интернете.\nКапли при первых же тревожных симптомах можно смыть!\nНа ваш взгляд, естественно, что вы назначаете, то, что считаете правильным, как иначе. Вопрос только в том, есть ли необходимость во всём сразу и есть же альтернативы, важно предлагать человеку выбор.\nЯ-то найду, если захочу. А вот вы бы лучше прислушивались к критике(обратите внимание, что моя оценка пока положительная), а не пользовались тем, что сейчас столько ленивых и занятых людей, что им не до изучения инфы. Свою же репутацию портите.",positive,ru

"Megabus is a service that is constantly improving. Better busses, better staff, better punctuality, more locations. It isn't glamorous, and it isn't necessarily comfortable or exciting, but it'll get you there.\n\nMy usual trip on the megabus is along the Pittsburgh-State College-New York line. The trip goes as follows: Board the megabus in Pittsburgh, get to State College 3 hours later, stop for 10 minutes while people get off and others board, stop at a Pilot/Subway for 25 minutes about 2 hours later(If you're reading this from the bus and wondering how long until you can get a bottle of water, it's exit 256 on rt-80), get to NYC about 3 hours later. There are some potential congestion points: The Squirrel Hill tunnels if you're leaving at rush hour(4:40p bus), and the Lincoln tunnels entering NYC(I've been caught up here for about 40 minutes once).\n\nLateness used to be a very common thing with the Megabus. When my girlfriend would grab a bus home from State College, we'd usually wait about 30 minutes for it to come, once it took at least 2 hours to come(Maybe longer, we left since she couldn't get a bus in Pittsburgh when she got back). Once it came and left 20 minutes early without waiting for her. Don't try calling customer service about it(This may have changed), they don't care - the phone number they give is to a call center, and you have to convince them to give you the real customer service number. I called asking for a refund for the bus that was 2 hours late and I was given the run-around. \""I'll leave a note for my manager, she'll call you back\"", no call - Called the manager \""I didn't see anything about this, let me check for your reservation number, hold on\"", silent hang-up. After that for some reason I could never get through to a customer service rep again, hm.\n\nLately it hasn't been late, though, and the busses have been upgraded. They used to have 1 socket per seat and sketchy wifi. The wifi is now more stable and there are 2 sockets per seat. If you have to sit next to someone, it's a lot less comfortable, but if you get the room of two seats it isn't that bad. If you sit up front on the top level you get a little extra legroom, too. However, the maximum prices have also gone up. It used to only cost $30 to go to NY, now it's $45 if you're late to the party. You can still get tickets for $1.50, and they release them a few months at a time, so I personally just spend about $10-20 on tickets if I catch them when they're just released to have the option of going.\n\nAlso the last time I went the staff in Pittsburgh was really friendly. These guys get a lot of stupid questions and complaints(On my bus home, a lady who spoke little English argued for 15 minutes that there were zero seats on the bus for the rest of her family. Sure enough, there were actually six seats and only 4 of them. Still, she argued there were zero and that they could not go home), so they really have to have a lot of patience to be in that position. Also, the one bus driver whose name is Frank, I think(He is kind of a bigger dude, wears a Steelers cap), is really funny so if you get him that's a bonus.\n\nAll-in-all it's a cheap trip from point A to point B. In Pittsburgh you board under the convention center, so you don't have to wait in the rain or anything. In New York, no such luck.",negative,en

*Good
- Staff was helpful and attentive
- Bed was comfortable
* Average
- The entrance isn't well marked or obvious at first pass
- The bedside alarm wasn't reset, so I was woken up at 6 am by a shrieking alarm clock that I didn't set

"One of, if not the worst film to come out of Britain in the 80s. This tawdry tale of a middle aged lecher who 'seduces' two teenage scrubbers who babysit for him and his faux-posh wife has nothing to redeem it.In turns gratuitous, puerile, uncouth and unrealistic, this film plumbs the depths as it fails miserably in its attempts to be funny, provocative, intellectual and controversial. Perhaps the worst thing about this film is the way the strong cast of George Costigan, Michelle Holmes and Siobhan Finneran are completely stitched by such a lame script. It's no surprise that this was the late Andrea Dunbar's only work to make it onto the screen. Complete and utter rubbish on every level.",negative,en

"We stayed at the Chelsea hotel last month for 4 days. I had always wanted to stay here as I am fascinated by the history and the art in this hotel. The art is amazing and I would recommend calling in to see it. The downside is that the hotel is severly run down. I found it such a shame that a hotel with this history has not maintained basic standards you would expect from a hotel such as a hairdryer, good air con and a room that is decorated properly. The walls had been paited over dozens of times and you could have easily kicked the door down.
I was dissapointed as I had e-mailed the hotel previously after reading some bad reviews and had expressed my concerns. The e-mail I received was quite sharp basically telling me that the hotel is not for everyone and if I didn't like it I should stay at a W hotel but they did say that my request had been noted.
When we arrived and was shown our room I called reception and asked to be moved. The guy on reception was very apologitic and he admitted that the hotel is not for everyone. I would point out that I am not a snob and I have stayed in worse places but I felt let down. The room we moved to was bigger and slightly better.
To be fair the rooms are clean and bigger than you would see in most New York hotels. The residents that live here really make the hotel. You could sit in the lobby all day and watch the many different characters pass by. We even saw Matthew Modine in the lift!!
If this hotel had a facelift to the rooms whilst still maintaing the history and character of the hotel I would come back . Other than that I would give it a miss to stay but definetly call in to walk the corridors.",negative,en

"I stayed at New York Hotel Marrakech from 22nd June for five days with a friend for her 30th We booked and pre-paid for a twin room through lastminute.com but on arrival were given a double. The reception staff were friendly and polite but all they could offer us was a room exchange the next day with an upgrade fee. The double room (44) was clean and comfortable so we stayed there.
Positives: The room was very clean and there was a maid service every day, plasma TV and decent aircon. After reading posts about bed bugs we checked all bedding defore using it, everything was clean and fresh and we did not get bitten during our stay. The hotel is four blocks away from Central Park and there is a number 1 (red line) subway station literally outside the door so you can get everywhere you need to with ease and at a low cost. The hotel is above a Starbucks but I found the café “Hot and Crusty” just a two minute walk up the road a lot better with loads of choice for breakfast or lunch.
Down sides; No lifts and no internet in the room but there is free Wi-Fi in the reception area only. The view from our room was interesting and a down side if occupied (see picture). Storage space was minimal for two females.
If you’re planning to see many sites all over the city I would recommend getting a 7-Day subway pass it Cost: $29 you can have unlimited trips and runs till midnight every day. Pedicab tour is a brilliant way to see all the famous spots round central park especially if the weather is good. A great night out is the comedy cellar, easy to get to very cheap and really funny: <url>",neutral,en

"Where the Rivers Flow North is a well-told story about two peoples' fight to live their own lives in the face of ""progress"" and development.

Very well done for a low-budget, locally-produced film. I found Michael J. Fox's character the weakest in the film, but Rip Torn and Tantoo Cardinal turn in two of the finest performances I've seen in a long time.

Also cooking food at the table is still entertaining and several dishes come with a million little addons. \n\nThe Bad: The staff were clearly running their asses off but we didn't see a lot of our waiter. Maybe we were supposed to wave them down, I saw this being done a few times (and not in an impolite fashion). All the interactions we had with the staff were good, but they were clearly overburdened.

Питание хорошее.Персонал вежливый. \nБыло всё отлично до наступления сна, как у них написано в ""23:00 соблюдайте тишину"".И сейчас буду писать негатив, так как отдых наш был испорчен...\nДля начала- если нет финансов на кондиционеры в номерах, можно хотя бы поставить вентиляторы, но их наверное не куда будет втыкать, так как розетки большинство не работают.\nИз за жары ночью открыты окна и соответственно налетели сквозь сетку мелкие мошки, которые нас искусали.И опять же если взять с собой фумигатор, то розетки сломаны.Пришлось окна всётаки закрыть и по итогу от духоты мы проснулись с ужасной головной болью. \nИ ""вишенкой на торте"" было одновременно с нами заселение выпускников подростков с 2 мя взрослыми. Их заселили к нам на этаж. За ними абсолютно никто не следил. Они носились по коридорам и орали до 4 утра, даже один раз пытались зайти к нам в номер🤦‍♀️Детей своих я еле уложила спать, сама уснула только в пятом часу и пришлось уже проснуться в 7 утра, так как эти подростки начали опять носиться и орать по коридорам. \nИз за жары и от недосыпа мы проснулись в отвратительном состоянии. И домой уехали не дожидаясь завтрака.\nВпечатления очень отвратительные от этого отдыха. Больше мы туда точно не поедем. Ценник не маленький, а комфорта 0.",negative,ru

"Decent place if you want to gorge down on some rather hefty portions, but for the price you pay, there's much better places to spend your money at in Vegas.\n\nSo it doesn't even compare to the original Serendipity in NYC, but on a scorching day walking around the strip, cooling down with a bowl of frozen hot chocolate is a genius idea...so you'd think. It's a shame that they can even manage to mess THAT up. How hard is it to use a blender? I'd like to not sip on cubes of ice in my slushy, thanks. Granted, they do have more flavors of the frozen hot chocolate here (Oreo, peanut butter, mint, etc.). If you want to keep it strictly Vegas-style, the bartender will even throw in a shot of rum for that extra umph. Of course, for an extra $10, I'd rather gamble away at the tables and order a few cocktails there instead...\n\nI can't say I'm able to compare the actual food to the NYC location since I've only tried desserts, but the mac n' cheese here was pretty legit. However, for $14?? I can buy 14 boxes of Kraft for that and be just as satisfied.",negative,en

"At last, a film to rival 'El Padrino' and 'Darkness Falls' in terms of sheer and utter dullness. This is actually the first film I've ever given 1 out of 10 for on IMDb, and with good reason.For one, the cast is nothing special. That's usually not a problem for me except that the only character that's in anyways interesting or different from all the rest is Grand L. Bush's Harrington. Secondly, the production values a substandard - television sci-fi such as 'Stargate' has more convincing sets, and all of the underwater scenes NOT handled by the SFX teams are filmed on dry sets with 'falling particles' that aren't very convincing. This film is literally 'drydocked'. The worst part though is that this film is BORING. For the first 45 minutes, I felt as if we were going round and round in circles: ""It's a prehistoric shark."" ""Bullsh*t."" ""No really."" ""Bullsh*t."" ""I'm not making this up."" ""Bullsh*t."" ""There it is now!"" ""I didn't see anything."" ""Let me guess?"" ""Yup. Bullsh*t."" After then it picks up ever so slightly for about twenty minutes or so. Then we're back to the dialog run-around. Dialog is not a bad thing, but that's all this film has. Characters talking. That too, is not a bad thing, except this film isn't very good at it. The dialog is often contrived and clichéd, and is not very interesting to listen to. I don't see any point slandering the special effects; this film has worse qualities.The sets are small and unrealistic. The acting is sub-par. The script - oh Lord, the script - is worse than a garbage of sci-fi television has to dredge up. It makes you wonder where the budget of this film is or was.Yet another awful, awful addition to the 'Megaloadon' (there's about four) series of films. Bring on Steve Alten, please...",negative,en

"Sushi Hibiki is one of the best sushi bars that I've ever visited in Kuala Lumpur. They serve the finest-quality, in-season ingredients imported from across the world, and strive to give patrons a true feel of the Japanese sushi-bar culture. All the fish served is fresh and ""clean-tasting"" (you can really taste all the flavours of the fish!), and the ratio of fish to rice is perfect (if you fill up easily, you can request for the chef to make your sushi with less rice). If you are lucky enough to catch the seasonal produce, I would highly recommend having a go at the saltwater uni, shinko fish, fresh ikura and fresh edamame. To keep up the practice of serving only the freshest ingredients, Sushi Hibiki operates with a set menu, but you are welcome to order any additional sushi / item that you fancy (with additional charges of course).Amazing food aside, Chef Sam and his team are very friendly thus creating a comfortable ambience in the restaurant. I've had some of the most beautiful dining experiences eating here with Sam and his team.The restaurant is quite small and exclusive, therefore prior reservations are recommended. I suggest taking a seat at the counter where you can watch the chefs at work, and engage in friendly conversation.",positive,en

"I'll start by saying that this hotel has an excellent location for getting about the city. The room was no worse than we had anticipated but could do with some redecoration. My main gripe with the hotel was the inadequacy of the sound proofing. A neighbouring room had for some reason a CD or radio playing the same song continuously all through the night every night. After ringing security the music stopped only to start again the following night. To top it off we got a wake-up call at 5.45am on our check-out morning which we hadn't requested. When I went down to reception to investigate, the lady asked me if the room was under...and gave me my name without so much as querying who I actually was. I would normally expect to be asked ""what name is the room under?""

"I, unfortunately, rarely make it out to this part of town. When I do, I tend to go an binges, scarfing down food from one or two of my favorite spots, and adding a new place that has been on my must-try list. This time, it was La Condesa. \n\nEverything about La Condesa took me by surprise, regardless of the high expectations I already had. I loved its interior--the small space, the rustic wood furniture, the artwork, everything. A big departure from the usual feel of cheap-mexican restaurants/taquerias, it felt homey, warm, inviting. I was expecting to just shoot a quick order to the girl at the counter, but instead got table service, and extremely friendly and attentive service to boot (sounds like it's usually an order-at-the-counter place, though). \n\nOn to the food: don't expect the usual suspects at the salsa bar--these salsas and toppings were phenomenal. I didn't ask, but I suspect they were all made in-house, and seemed incredibly fresh and were really a unique assortment. A great mellow, nutty peanut sauce, smokey chipotle salsa, creamy/salty cilantro, an awesome Mexican (or was it Mayan?) salsa (my favorite of what I tried)...my only regret was not sampling more.\n\nWhat I loved about the menu were the unique options that branched far beyond the usual suspects. I went with three tacos: tinga, mole, cochinita pibil. When they arrived, all of them looked beautiful, and were surprisingly and thankfully chocked-full of meat. I took one bite of the mole and...HO...LY.....SHIT. Ever go to a restaurant and casually take a bite of something without giving it too much thought, only to be immediately punched in the face by its deliciousness? I love it when this happens. It's one of those pure joys in life, and happens far too infrequently...but it happened here. I'm a sucker for any type of mole, but sometimes they fall a bit 'flat'. This one did not. It had a fantastic bite and complexity to it that really elevated the mole to one of the best I've had. The tinga and cochinita were both equally great. The meat in all three was insanely tender and flavorful from the great sauces they had simmered in.\n\nI paid the bill--$9.80--and realized that it was an awesome deal. Sure, you can find tacos in town for less than $3/ea, but they will not be like these. Not to mention, the portions were generous, I got free chips and a run at the salsa bar. \n\nI drove home feeling like I was teetering on the edge of purging...this was, after all, my second substantial meal in the course of 1 hour. But it was well worth it. Adding yet another spot to my list of places I have to hit when in the area. Already searching for an excuse.",positive,en

"I like that Blackfinn has three distinct atmospheres that it implements in any given day. \n\n1) In the early afternoon and evenings, the establishment resembles any typical American bar, offering a decent selection of drinks (at normal market prices), and a number of different pub foods with sports coverage on all of their many mounted televisions.\n\n2) One also has the choice of forgoing the bar and having a dine-in experience with a full waiting staff in a much quieter and cleaner setting. The food is presented nicely and tastes quite good for a pub. Blackfinn, hands down, has the best Lime Grilled Salmon that I've had in Charlotte. The fish is nicely crisp on the outside, with a salty bite and flaky core. Sandwiches are also delicious/cheap and the french fries resemble the extra crispy french fries at Burger King. Go for the Blackened Chicken Sandwich! Notable appetizers: Ying & Yang Shrimp, Spinach and Artichoke Dip, and Blackened Brie\n\n3) At nights and on most (some?) weekends, the bar turns into a makeshift nightclub. You'll always find this place packed on a Saturday evening with a live DJ spinning upstairs and a large dance floor that gets filled around midnight when everyone is wasted out of their minds. You have to pay cover, but it isn't very much and the music is semi-ok :)\n\nAlways come here with company, otherwise you'll stick out like a sore thumb. Often you'll see the Charlotte workforce coming here after work for a quick pint, so don't feel awkward if you're the only one dressed casually. Waiting staff is friendly and attentive. Just don't piss anyone off :P\n\nThe tables are kinda (inevitably) sticky!!\n\n4/5",neutral,en

"Yet again, I appear to be the only person on planet Earth who is capable of criticizing Japanese films made before 1970. ""Fires on the Plain"" (1959) is another in the seemingly endless line of ""classics"" that get all sorts of praise for no apparently good reason. As much as I love to overgeneralize and psychoanalyze all of these moviegoers who have such horrible taste in film, it's still nearly impossible to rationalize why anyone would ever think that poorly made fluff like this should be proclaimed as some sort of ""masterpiece."" What I find truly ironic is that fans of derivative ""classics"" like ""Fires on the Plain"" focus so much on ""inside the box"" movie-making (orthodox grading standards like scriptwriting, acting, camera-work, etc.) yet it always seems like the most highly revered ""classics"" are most deficient in these very standards. For example, one of the laziest copouts for a filmmaker involves forced verbal exposition where characters basically explain everything for the viewer even when the constructed scenario is totally artificial. Most surprisingly, the very first scene in ""Fires on the Plain"" uses this indolent tactic to the extreme.After a funny head slap, the following useless dialogue assaults the viewer, ""Why can't you grasp the situation? We landed to the west under heavy fire to reinforce units at Tacloban. We lost two-thirds of our men. Our artillery was sunk in transit. We tried to reach Burauen airfield by crossing the central mountains but without artillery it was impossible. The enemy's counterattack forced a fanout across the valley. You know that."" So why, exactly, is one character telling another character something he already knows? Oh yeah, that's right, the makers of this film are too lazy to think of more natural ways to communicate this information. You see, a quality film would actually show these events happening, or at worst it would involve dialogue involving one character who has no knowledge of those events. Heck, even an opening summary in paragraph form directed at the viewer would have been better than what transpired here.Such instances of poor quality movie-making are littered throughout ""Fires on the Plain"" to the point where this film feels like it was written by imbeciles for imbeciles. For example, the lead character stumbles upon some skeletons wrapped in Japanese garb. Instead of doing the natural thing like  oh I don't know  giving a depressed mannerism, the character blurts out ""Japanese soldiers."" Thanks buddy, but I could have figured that one out for myself.Even worse, this movie is saturated with over-dramatic ploys. The most ridiculous scene involves a pair of boots. Picture this. A soldier walks along and finds a pair of worn out boots. One would think that such a find is utterly useless, but it turns out that the soldier's boots are in even worse condition, so he picks up the worn boots and leaves his SUPER worn boots behind. Fine, I get the point. The soldiers are in rough shape  a fact that is already clearly emphasized with their worn boots to begin with. The scene is ridiculous, but I was ready to let it go, until the SECOND soldier arrives! You see, he finds the previous soldier's SUPER worn boots and notices  get ready, cause here it comes  that his boots are SUPER DUPER worn boots! Lucky man, he picks up the SUPER worn boots and leaves his SUPER DUPER worn boots behind. But you see, that's not all  because the THIRD soldier then arrives! He finds the previous soldiers SUPER DUPER worn boots and inspects them, along with his own SUPER DUPER worn boots. Since both pairs suck, he tosses them both aside and smiles as he continues barefoot. At this point I was ready to throw my television through my living room window. The heavy handedness, overdramaticism, and paramount absurdity of this sequence is beyond bad film-making. It's SUPER DUPER bad film-making.There are a number of similar, completely stupid moments to be had. Like the time when the lead character asks someone, ""Hey, are you dead?"" Like the guy is going to answer ""Yes"" if he actually kicked the bucket. I'll also be the first to condemn the subpar performance of the lead actor, who is the quintessential posterchild for artificial reaction. I laughed hard during that opening head slap where his head slingshot back in place with this stupid, goofy expression on his face.The fact that this trivial fluff piece gets an IMDb average rating of 8.4 while a certifiable masterpiece like ""A Tale of Two Sisters"" (2003) only gets a 7.5 is the height of mass stupidity. And to think that some people actually delude themselves into thinking that ""AToTS"" doesn't make sense. Well, not every movie can have completely outrageous SUPER DUPER worn boots on its side.",negative,en

"I will agree with those reviews that are claiming the food was bland. It really, really, was. I had the Lobster Ravioli and boyfriend had Potato Wrapped Salmon. His portion was generous, and salmon cooked well, but there was very little flavor. No use of herbs, spices, seasoning..nothing. My lobster ravioli was a fairly skimpy portion for $25 ... four decently sized ravioli and 3 small shrimp. Once again, I wouldn't mind this, had it not been so bland. The sauce was completely unimaginative and left a lot to be desired.\n\nThe service was adequate. We were seated immediately and our server was fine.

هذه البلد آن لها أن تستقر علي أيدينا . ميزة كلاب الراعي هو ألقاء الضوء علي فترة من الزمان كانت أيدينا هنا تشير إلي المماليك، الفرنسيس، الإنجليز، الباب العالي ، محمد علي ،ولا عزاء للمصريين. ولكن هل تغير الحال الأن؟. قد تقوم دولة بعض الوقت بمستبد كفء، ولكن لا يوجد أبدا مستبد عادل . قالها الكثير من الحكام السابقين وحتي حاكمها الحالي. من ونحن لا نسمع سوي عن الأستقرار المزعوم علي أيدي أحد الرعاه. قالها مبارك واصفا سنة ، أستقر فيها الفقر والمرض علي حالهم، وأستقر رجال ا عمال المرضي عليهم في تحقيق الثروات. قالها المجلس العسكري واصفا حال مصر بعد الثورة، ما يقرب من سنتين من ثورة مستمرة..هي ا مر الوحيد المستقر، الشباب كما هم في ثورتهم والأخوان يجهزون للسلطة مستقرين. قالها ا خوان بعدها ، إستقروا في مناصبهم وتركوا بقية الشعب مستقر كما هو، الفقراء في فقرهم، الشباب في ثورتهم. ثم قالها المجلس العسكري/مدني مرة أخري ، ليستقر الفقر مكانه، الشباب ثورتهم ولكن بقمع أكثر، وا خوان في تفجيراتهم وانتقامهم. وما أنعش هذا الإستقرار الذي تشهده البلاد ، وما أكثر كلاب الراعي بيننا ، أيا كان الراعي. لو عاش بطل الرواية حتي ا ن والذي كان يدون التاريخ في مخطوطات ، لمات كمدا. فهنا الرواية تعود لبداية القرن التاسع عشر..قبل مذبحة مروعة شهيرة..من أجل البلد التي آن وقتها أن تستقر. والبطل هنا هو. الحسن بن جمال الدين الرومي ، الشاطر حسن. . ورحلته في الجهاد مع محمد علي باشا وأتباعه ضد المماليك التي أزداد نفوذها با خص مع الحملة الإنجليزية ، إزداد ضغيانها والظلم تجاه المصريين الذين عاشوا أزهي عصور فرض الضرائب، والفقر..وتنتهي بصعود محمد علي إلي الحكم. صعوده ليحقق الإستقرار لهذه البلد التي آن ، وقتها ، أن تستقر. كتاريخ أعتقد أنها ممتازة في كثير من الجوانب ، كيف كان أخر عهد المماليك؟ ودور الإنجليز فيه، وتعجبت لإستمرار وجود الفرنسيس حيث لم أعلم هذا قبلا وتقديمهم لمشروع قناة السويس لمحمد علي، كما صور الكتاب حياة الشعب المصري بهذا الوقت ونظرة ا جانب لنا، ولا تنس أن المماليك وحتي محمد علي نفسه منهم...أجانب. وصف مصر و ا سواق وحركة ا بطال بين القاهرة ، جزيرة الزمالك و الصعيد كانت ممتازة وتشعر فعلا انك انتقلت لتلك الأجواء الساحرة. وصف المولد أيضا كان موفقا ولكن يعيب الوصف المشاهد الجنسية التي كان يمكن الإستغناء عنها في بعض المواقف ، او إختصارها كما للأسف تم إختصار الجزء التاريخي بالنهاية ...فحتي الفصل قبل ا خير شعرت بعده أني كنت أريد معرفة المزيد، ماذا حدث بعد أن تولي محمد علي الحكم أدي لأحداث نهاية الكتاب، ماذا حدث لمشروع قناة السويس المقدم من الفرنسيس وما دار بين محمد علي وبينهم، لماذا ما حدث لعمر مكرم و جرجس بعد توليه الحكم؟. كما يعيب الجزء التاريخي في بعض ا جزاء كأجزاء المعارك أنه كان مجرد سرد للأحداث فقط ولكن للأسف هذا كان سببا لئلا يرق لي الجانب الروائي بها بشكل كبير.. كان سرد فحسب مما لم يجعلني اتعايش مع كثير من الأجزاء. كمثلا تجد جزء ك فدخل س القاعة ليجد ص الذي يهمس بكلمات في أذنه ثم يدخل للوالي ، فيخبره بما حدث ويخرج من عنده عازما علي ما خططه أو أجزاء أخري يأتي بها الحوار جامدا وتقليديا في بعض ا حيان. يجب أن أشير أنني من المعجبين بقلم أستاذ أشرف العشماوي وتنويعه في الروايات، ولكن ما جعل تقييمي للرواية ينخفض هو أن بين صفحات الكتاب التي تعج بمشاهد سردية مقتضبة هناك رواية ملحمية تصرخ تريد أن تروي لكن كتمها الاختصار. الإختصار هنا قدم بعض الأحداث التاريخية والمعارك مكتوبة بطريقة جافة ، أو شخصيات ليست بالعمق الكافي للتعاطف معها بشكل كلي فلم يؤدي لتسارع ا حداث للأسف بقدر إقتضابها. فرواية عن أخر عهد المماليك، صعود محمد علي، وتنتهي بمذبحته الشهيرة تحتمل أو صفحة علي ا قل. ربما ن ما قرأته من روايات تاريخية كان عملاقا مثل رواية. سقوط العمالقة لكين فوليت. ، أو تاريخ غير حقيقي ك. لعبة العروش لجورج آر آر مارتن. تخطي كلاهما ال صفحة قطع كبير. ما يجعلني متأكدا من هذا هو أنني لم أتعايش مع شخصية الشاطر حسن سوي عندما بدأ جزء رحلته إلي الصعيد حيث كان في الرواية مكتوبا بأسلوب البطل حسن هو الراوي ..وبشكل ممتاز. كما أن بعد منتصف الرواية أيضا كانت هناك أجزاء كثيرة لأخيه كمال الدين مطولة فيها حديث نفسي وهي أيضا كتبت ببراعة ،وربما أدت لتعاطفي حتي مع شخصيته في النهاية. حتي محمد علي في بعض ا جزاء البسيطة كان مكتوبا بعمق. ولكن بعض النظر عن كل هذا ، فالشخصية الوحيدة التي قدمت هنا بشكل مطول ويليق بها وبوصف خلاب ، بشكل واقعي ومؤسف بنفس الوقت هي البلد. مصر. البلد التي آن لها أن تستقر. من القرن الثامن عشر وحتي ا ن نبحث عن إستقرار حقيقي لها، ولكن كلاب الراعي لا ترعاها قدر رعايتها للراعي نفسه..ولمصلحتها ومصلحة الراعي. بلد تبحث إستقرار لشعبها الذي لعشقه وشوقه للإستقرار قد يرضي بإستقرارات زائفة مؤقتة. يفسدها دائما كلاب الراعي. محمد العربي. من أبريل . إلي ابريل,neutral,ar

Als der Gürtel bei mir ankam, war ich total zufrieden. Das Leder und die Schnalle machen einen sehr hochwertigen Eindruck und das Gesamtbild sah an jeder Hose wirklich sehr gut aus. Ich nutze den Gürtel jetzt seit ca. 3 Monaten regelmäßig und ehrlich gesagt bin ich nun etwas enttäuscht. Das Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis schien am Anfang top zu sein, nun hat der Zahn der Zeit aber doch ganz schön seine Spuren hinterlassen. Die Schnalle ist auf der Oberseite total abgekratzt und sieht durch den Orangestich wie Rost aus. Das Leder ist rundum noch in einem super Zustand, nur an der Schnalle sind helle Verfärbungen erkennbar, die aber momentan gar nicht weiter auffallen oder stören. Dass nach gerade einmal 3 Monaten die Schnalle allerdings so aussieht, finde ich sehr schade bzw. ärgerlich und hätte das von Pierre Cardin im Vorfeld nicht erwartet.",negative,de

"Druckstellen im Buch - Poster nicht kindgerecht
Ich habe einmal bestellt ohne die Rezension zu lesen - ein Fehler! Das Buch sollte ein Geschenk für einen Kindergeburtstag sein. Das Poster erschien mir als nette Zugabe. Doch: Das Poster ist nicht - wie man auf der Produktabbildung vermuten könnte - in einer Rolle der Bestellung beigefügt, sondern mehrfach gefaltet mit Büroklammern (wer kommt auf so eine Idee???) in dem Buch befestigt. Die Büroklammern haben in dem Buch an den Seiten die damit in Berührung kamen deutliche Druckstellen hinterlassen! Druckstellen sieht man bei genauer Betrachtung auch an dem Poster. Dieses ist allerdings so wenig kindgerecht (das Buch ist empfohlen für 4-7 Jahre und den Bildern nach zu urteilen dafür auch passend). Zudem ist das Poster durch das Falten so zerknickt, dass es sich sicher niemand an die Wand hängen würde. Diese Bestellung geht zurück! Das Tiptoi-Buch an sich ist (wie von tiptoi gewohnt) nett aufgemacht. Ich werde es nochmal bestellen - allerdings von einem anderen Anbieter und ohne Poster.",negative,de
"This is one of those airport hotels that you'll probably choose if you need to stay a night and close to the airport for your next day flight, but we stayed there mostly because I was supposed to get a shuttle from the airport on my own and I didn't want to pay a lot for a shuttle to some hotel closer to the city. Plus, we had a car, so reaching Houston downtown wasn't that much of a problem. Well, if you don't have problems with navigating Houston highways, which can be a bit challenging. The hotel isn't big, it's clean, the staff was very friendly and helpful, so the lady at the front desk told us to go eat to the near by restaurant where we got 15% discount for her reference, which was a nice gesture. The hotel room was a regular size with two big queen beds and a smaller bathroom. The noise from the airport wasn't notable because of the sound proof windows, but the AC was pretty noisy and it was pointing towards the beds. The breakfast was an usual buffet with good choice of food. Overall, a pretty decent two nights stay.",positive,en
