"Une vraie mine d’informations
Pour avoir suivi pas mal de formations de marketing à plusieurs milliers d’euros, je dois dire que ce livre regroupe à lui seul toutes les connaissances à avoir pour vendre en dépassant les mécanismes de défense complètement inconscients de chaque consommateur. Il est bourré d’exemples et m’a vraiment permis de comprendre ce qui pouvait manquer sur mes pages de vente et quoi mettre en avant dans mes discours, et cela porte ses fruits. En bref c’est un excellent investissement, l’auteur donne de vraies clés, de vraies pépites (contrairement à d’autres livres qui restent vraiment théoriques) et à mon sens c’est un réel ouvrage de référence que je recommande complètement à toute personne qu’elle soit néophyte ou qu’elle souhaite simplement mieux vendre.",positive,fr
"I stayed at this hotel for one night in December 2011, and was extremely underwhelmed with the service and quality I experienced at the property. It was certainly not what have come to expect from the Hilton family. Although the location was excellent (only a short walk from many of New York's major attractions), the room was small, the heating was up too high with no way to adjust the thermostat, and worst of all, all of the water sources in the room released brown water with a pungent odour - this in a city renowned for the quality of its tap water! I called the ""Careline"" and was told an engineer was being sent to the room, but no engineer ever came. I was eventually able to get clean water myself by running the taps for about fifteen minutes.
Hilton HHonors Gold members should also be wary of this hotel. It took a considerable amount of effort - several phone calls both to front desk and HHonors, and two physical visits downstairs - to receive the free breakfast to which Gold members are entitled. I was given several stories by staff as to why I was not entitled to a free breakfast, including that Hilton has stopped offering breakfast to Gold members, or that this hotel is a franchise that has opted out of the breakfast benefit for Golds. I confirmed with Hilton HHonors that neither of these excuses are true. Eventually I was told by the Duty Manager that the Executive Lounge (where breakfast is usually taken) was closed due to the renovations that commenced two days before my stay, but that I was able to take my free breakfast in the hotel restaurant instead. This was all well and good, but I have since found out that other HHonors members have been in the Executive Lounge on and after the date of my stay - so this was a lie as well! It seems that hotel staff, management included, have no clue what they are talking about when it comes to HHonors benefits.",negative,en

"Just utter trash. I'm a huge fan of the Cusacks, this being the sole reason I watched this movie, but the only reason I can see for their presence was the reprise, in complete and depth less quality, their exact roles from Grosse Point Blanc. Apart from that, the films' role as a political satire fails miserably as being too obvious for even the most moronic out there to serve any purpose. And to bill it as a satirical satire would be just plain insulting even to chimps. Imitation is, apparently the highest form of flattery, but seeing as though this is nothing near Grosse Point Blanc and in the same league as meet the (watch if your a moron) Spartans in terms of political satire, lets leave well enough alone and let this one fade into the obscurity it absolutely deserves.",negative,en

"""Django"" ne dispose en réalité que d'une seule suite ""officielle"". Pour autant, un nombre impressionnant de westerns de série B, C, D jusqu'à Z a voulu s'en réclamer, parmi eux des films n'ayant absolument rien à voir avec Django comme de bien entendu. Malgré l'absence de Franco Nero, je ne pense pas que ce soit le cas du film ci-présent. Il s'agit ici d'expliquer la substance profondément psychopathe du personnage, telle qu'elle explosait à l'écran dans le film original. Intéressant sur le papier, mais dans les faits ce n'est rien de plus qu'une tentative fauchée autour d'un personnage honnêtement plus imaginaire que mythique. Le scénario est à la rigueur défendable (quoi que le coup du mec qui pète les plombs dès qu'il voit une étoile de sheriff... c'est digne des parodies de Rambo), mais la réalisation est dans les choux. Le réalisateur a beau faire joujou avec la caméra, il ne sait absolument pas filmer, si bien que presque tout se passe hors-champ en fin de compte. Alors que l'un des coups de génie de Corbucci était de saturer excessivement ses couleurs histoire de surligner la violence, elles sont ici excessivement désaturées, le film entraînant le spectateur dans un ennui léthargique dont il ne sortira qu'au gré de séquences trèèèès légèrement décalées (le duel dans le noir, le duel à cheval, etc.), mais dans lequel il retombera illico après avoir saisi la ponctuelle ""bonne idée"" (car même ces séquences sont mal mises en scène). Le casting est à la rue, certains personnages effarants de stupidité (Daniel et Robert, mes nouveaux héros !), le doublage plutôt marrant, la musique sans aucune substance. Un film qui tente d'innover, mais qui n'y arrive désespérément pas. Vous pouvez l'oublier celui-là.",negative,fr

Had an extremely knowledgeable waitress named Rachel that made fantastic recommendations based on the true preparation of the dishes. There was too much that we wanted to try on their far from ordinary menu, full of interesting dishes. We went with the Beef tartar appetizer which was so fantastic, smooth, flavorful and the delicious egg topped it off perfectly. We also tried the tuna taquitas which were great as well. The Fried Pickles are a must have, the breading is incredible but they are huge. For entrees we enjoyed the Moules Frites with White Wine Garlic Broth, which the girlfriend said where some of the best she ever had. I enjoyed their signature duck dish, this was such fresh meat but what really made it for me was the pastrami edging. The sauerkraut pierogoies were a nice side of the dish aswell. Dont miss out on their drinks, this was the best Manhattan cocktail ive ever had! Also enjoyed a drink called the Perfect Sour, that was a great addition similar to a Pisco Sour.

Their boot selection rivals a shoe warehouse's and they have a ton of shoes on clearance. The home goods, awesome. A surprisingly large collection of cook books, have even found a fiction book I was planning on buying as a gift off amazon. I was actually surprised how many gourmet food items they have, and the selection of really nice kitchen wares (even most of the line from the Palm Restaurant). If you need a green olive stuffed with anything other than a pimento - you can find it at this Marshall's! Tons of kids toys, children's clothing, and a good selection of electronics accessories (ear buds, head phones, etc) as you check out. \n\nNot much help as far as while you're shopping, but the cashiers are usually super friendly. It's clean, its nicely set up, and if you didn't prepare yourself to spend an hour sifting through the racks, there is a well kept bathroom in the back left corner.",neutral,en

"Absolutely delicious! Last weekend I had my second meal at BLT Steak and it was even better than I had remembered. \n\nThe popovers with sea salt and that delicious butter are amazing. They are huge and filling, so take your time / don't eat it all if you can help it.\n\nThe crab cake appetizer is delicious and very different from most crab cake appetizer arrangements I've previously tasted. I feel like with a restaurant like this I shouldn't even bother saying it, but the crab cake was actually comprised of real crab. Definitely worth a try! \n\nWhatever rub they use on the meat is phenomenal. We couldn't get over how amazing our steaks tasted; aside from the great rub, the steaks were cooked to perfection. The sauces are totally unnecessary given how well they season the meat, but the roquefort sauce or red wine would be great choices.\n\nAs for sides... The jalapeno mashed potatoes are definitely a good choice. The onion rings are amazing and have a taste reminiscent of funnel cake (something I can't figure out about the batter and/or way it is fried - SO good). But I have to say that my favorite side is the parmesan gnocchi - melt in your mouth status.\n\nTo wrap it up, peanut butter chocolate mousse dessert (topped with banana ice cream) turned out to be an excellent choice even for someone who hates bananas.\n\nLocation inside the Ritz makes for a perfect dinner without going far from the hotel if you happen to be staying there. Or if you're visiting from outside of the Ritz, once you're done with dinner you can walk out to the lobby bar which seems to be very much alive on Saturday evenings and therefore makes for a quick transition from dinner to drinks!",positive,en

الرواية تخلوا من الابداع وعنصر المفاجأة. تنبأت باغلب الاحداث قبل ان تحدث.. بعض حبكات الرواية غير مقبولة. كأن يقول حوجن مثلا ان اسلوبه بالحديث اخذ الطابع الحجازي بسبب معاشرته للانس في الحجاز. وان بني جنسه من الجن الذين لم يختلطوا بالأنس لهم اسلوب بالحديث مختلف عن اهل الحجاز ، فيحاول حوجن اخفاء لهجته لكي لا يسخروا منه. و تتفاجئ بالصفحة التي تليها ان كل معشر الجن يتحدثوا باللهجة الحجازية . وفوق هذا لم يعجبني اسلوب الكاتب وهو يجعل حوجن يشرح كل شيء وكل حدث بدلا من ان يجعلنا نكتشفها مع الاحداث . لا اعلم إن تحسن اسلوب الكاتب بعد هذه الرواية، ولكن روايته هذه جدا متدنية من الناحية الأدبية ومن ناحية اخرى في الاحداث . هناك سببان دفعني لقراءة الرواية:. الاول: كتاب الجنية لد.غازي القصيبي والذي اعجبني كثيرا . الثاني: صيت الكتاب، والذي للاسف لا يستحقه بتاتا.,negative,ar

"I really enjoyed this book, a wonderful start to a new series. From the way the characters are introduced, how they meet each other, how their journey begins to how their journey ends, it is a wonderful story.I liked the fact that this story had a wide range of supernatural in it as well, not simply a vampire or shape-shifter. I have to say that this is the first time that I have had a Hob be, what appears to be, a central character in a series. Another fun change that I am sure will expand in the books to come.I love how these two met, and no I won't give away details & thus ruin the story, and I loved the extended family aspect as well; all of which will play a role in future stories I imagine. The antagonist was a lovely, wicked **tch whom couldn't stand that she could not have what her demented mind demanded. The other antagonist had a very meaningful, albeit very brief, and gruesome ending as well. It was another first for a characters ending!I have enjoyed this Authors books thus far, she writes easy to follow, believable stories that leave you rooting for the characters. It is not very often that I give a book a 5-star rating, mostly going as high as 4-stars, so that should speak of my enjoyment of this book. I have already purchased the others in the series, 3 more, and look forward to starting the next immediately. Enjoy! :)",positive,en

"I have read numerous times on this website how travellers believe they are treated with less respect because they have used an agency to book a room rather than dealing directly with the hotel. Having never experienced it, I'd read these reviews with some doubt, but when staying at the Intercontinental Times Square arriving 28 September '12, we encountered this first-hand ourselves. Not pleasant!
The room was meant to be ready at 3pm. We arrived at 6pm. The manager explained that due to the previous guest's late checkout, the room was not ready. I suggested we come back in half an hour, which he scoffed at & stated that a room takes at least an hour to clean. There was no apology, or offer of complimentary drinks at the bar, or anything.
We returned at 7:30, where the room was still not quite ready, and we were left lingering in the lobby for another half an hour, finally arriving in our room just after 8pm.
I went straight to the bar fridge for a relieving drink to find that 4 of the drinks had not been replaced from the previous guests. I rang front desk, so as to ensure these would not be billed to our account, but then felt paranoid about consuming anything fron the fridge in case what we had would simply be added to the missing products.
We may have used booking.com, but we still paid nearly $400 per night for this 'corner' room; thus we feel this level of service was just not good enough.
Naturally, the 'corner' we did receive faced the duller side of the city, but there were still good views to be had & we liked the room & bathroom. This, in addition to the helpful travel advice offered by the concierge downstairs during our 3 night stay, saved the review from the ignominious 1-star insult.",positive,en

"Documentaries in which sons and daughters seek to understand a parent and, by the process, their own lives are not that uncommon. Also not uncommon are results that reflect lack of talent, a failure of introspection, an abundance of narcissism and, perhaps, an unsubtle quest for publicly-splashed revenge for countless past hurts, real and fantasized. What is unusual is a brilliant, fair and engrossing portrait of a fascinating parent and ""My Architect: A Son's Journey"" is that rare achievement.Louis Kahn emigrated to this country as a child, his face irreparably and brutally scarred by an accident. He and his parents settled in Philadelphia where the talented youngster loved art and music. Soon he became enamored of buildings and decided only an architect's career would answer his creative abilities.Kahn became an architect but as this film shows it took a long time before he attracted the attention of the leaders in his field. One architect suggests that he was a victim of the ""yellow armband,"" that anti-Semitism that along with bias against women was long a disreputable aspect of the American profession of architecture.When he did achieve notice, he was seen, clearly accurately, as a self-assured, workaholic prophet exclaiming unyielding demands that his vision and only his vision be realized. That inflexibility was the reason that while he drew wonderful plans for many buildings he built but a few. The interview with an aged gentleman who fired Kahn in Philadelphia because of his unacceptable dream of a transformed urban center where people left their cars on the perimeter and walked into the city is hilarious.Kahn was a born teacher and some of the extensive archival footage here shows him with students, his voice steady but passionate, their gazes respectful and intense.Many architects were interviewed by director, writer and project honcho Nathaniel Kahn, the architect's only son. Some are world famous - I. M. Pei, Robert A.M. Stone, Moshe Safdie, Frank Gehry and the still active nonagenarian, Philip Johnson. Their comments paint a vivid picture of this idealistic but in the end financially unsuccessful designer of buildings that blended the castles, fortresses and grand buildings of past centuries into designs for the present. Kahn's buildings are shown, among the most impressive being the Salk Research Laboratories in La Jolla, CA. To me his style has a neo-Romantic air deadened by too much blank space that repels rather than attracts human interaction.But Kahn's son was after more than the story of his father, the architect. For many years Louis Kahn had three families: a wife with whom he had a daughter and two long-term relationships, one of which produced a daughter, the other the son. Kahn visited his son at the mother's home often but at the end of an evening mother and son would drive Kahn back to the marital home. Nathaniel clearly wanted to know about this unusual set of relationships but he doesn't appear to be scarred by what was certainly a strange affair for a little boy. When Nathaniel was a young boy Louis Kahn died of a massive heart attack in the men's room of New York's Pennsylvania Station after returning from India where he had pitched one of his massive projects, another one that was never built. At that point his Philadelphia firm was at least $500,000 in debt and had he lived a trip to the federal bankruptcy court was probably in the offing.Kahn left several monumental structures of which the government building in Bangladesh is clearly the biggest. A teary local architect hails Kahn for having created a building where democracy may (and hopefully will) flourish.Fellow architect Moshe Safdie opines that there might have been something fitting in Kahn's suffering a mortal heart attack in a train station given his incessant globetrotting. I disagree: it's sadly ironic that Kahn should die in the faceless replacement for one of America's true architectural gems, the old Pennsylvania Station, wrecked to make way for a sterile replacement with no character and no continuation of civic memory.There are a number of emotional moments filmed during the younger Kahn's journey, including with his half-sisters and his mother, but they're genuine and moving, not maudlin and staged. Historians of architecture will always study Kahn. His son found reasons to remember him as a flawed but very iconoclastic and ultimately private man.9/10.",positive,en

The other locations are inside MGM, the Mirage (the original store that opened in 2009) and inside the Miracle Mile shops connected to Planet Hollywood. I was heading towards the MGM branch as it was closer to Mandalay Bay, but during a phone conversation the MGM branch told me that the items I was looking for were at Paris. And so I went in 90F+ Vegas heat walking halfway north for at least a mile. The things I do for food.\n\nVENUE: This particular Sugar Factory is divided up in two: the actual storefront near Paris and their restaurant the American Brasserie further north. As the flagship storefront it sells everything from couture pops to candy and chocolates and other Sugar Factory themed memorabilia and apparel. The walls are lined with candy, the center area has their display of the non-edible items and the wall closest to the brasserie is the area where you can order the chocolate and other frozen treats. As advertised, both locations are open 24/7.\n\nThe signature product of Sugar Factory (if you haven't guessed from one of the 500+ reviews) is the couture pop endorsed by a handful of celebrities such as Britney Spears, Kim Kardashian, The Situation (wait, he's still relevant?), Mel B./Scary Spice, Nicky Minaj and Nicole Scherzinger. A package of one comes with one of the 9 flavors and there's another package of 3 refills. Out of sheer curiosity I asked for the sticker price of one of the couture pop holders, store clerk said $25. Big WTF. Even more shocking was that the pack of 3 refills go for $12. I am known in both my immediate and extended family for making pretty extravagant food purchases, but the couture pops were too much for even ME. That's saying something. \n\nInstead I went over to the counter where you could buy the frozen goods and satisfied my sweet tooth cravings for a little more than half the price of a couture pop. I bought two tipsy truffles for $3.95 each and a frozen hot chocolate for around $6.95. \n\nTipsy truffles are like cake pops with a bit of alcohol in them. \nCampfire S'mores: Had a burnt marshmallow top and graham cracker crust bottom. Had more chocolate than the red velvet. \nRuby Red Velvet: My favorite of the two. The red velvet had a cakelike texture with a biscuit bottom to keep shape. The top had red velvet sprinkles. \n\nFrozen Hot Chocolate: A little less rich than the one I had from Serendipity 3 a few years ago. I tasted little bits and pieces of a cake-like texture. Portion was big enough to sip for the long walk back to the Mandalay. It was good for what it was, but next time I'll try more of their sundaes and frozen milkshakes. Might stick to Serendipity 3 for frozen hot chocolates.\n\nTipsy truffles ARE pricey (normal for Vegas prices) but it's worth walking the Strip to get them. Next time I'll have to go back and try more flavors.",neutral,en
"The hotel has been remodeled very nicely, the location is excellent, and the interior is as swank and stylish as you'd expect from an Italian auto manufacturer. While the hotel is quite old, none of its original charm was retained. Unfortunately local historical preservation requirements demanded that they retain San Diego's oldest operating elevator (seriously). We've stayed in lots of boutique hotels, and actually prefer older preserved/remodeled ones, but we have never had an experience like this. The steam-driven elevator mechanism positively roars and shudders the rooms, making sleep impossible. The hotel's solution -- complimentary earplugs and a white noise machine -- work well enough, but for these prices and the boutique hotel experience Keating aspires to, it's quite a disappointment. Add to that the malfunctioning toilet in our room that went unrepaired, despite our numerous requests, for our entire 4 day stay, plus a massive screw-up of our reservation by the otherwise charming and eager staff, and we can't possibly recommend this place. (I should note that as ""amends"" for our experience we were given a coupon for two slices of pizza somewhere, and the manager removed the historical preservation tax from our room charge.) To sum up, the hotel is superficially glitzy and swanky and fashionable, and the staff tries hard to please, but the guest experience leaves a lot to be desired. There are many lovely options in San Diego; go elsewhere.",negative,en

The restaurant is always clean and the service is good. i like the fact that they have opportunities to support local fire departments.\n\nAt this location the new manager Ryan here gave us excellent customer service. My company uses this site for catering business lunches and he goes above and beyond to make sure our order is correct and that we are happy.",negative,en

"I wish I had read further into the reviews, where I would have found out that their Happy Hour at night is mainly beer and well drinks. I was excited to try a new place out, so me and the BGB went and checked out the place after his shift at work. The bartender was really nice, but the only person in there at midnight-ish on a Friday night. Apparently the kitchen closes around that time, but he was still able to get us some bar food. He was really nice though, so good customer service always rates high with me.\n\nWe split some chicken fingers and fries, which were good. Nothing breakthrough about them, but they certainly weren't bad. Apparently you have to get there a little earlier to get the full menu. Tab came out to about $27... most of it were my two Long Beach Iced Teas (at full price) vs. BGB's two Cran-Vodkas (at happy hour price).\n\nBut the place was just so dead. It was almost uncomfortably dead, as the only people in there for a while was me, the BGB, the bartender, and two other guys. On a Friday night. Now, I know Henderson's not exactly the swingin' night spot that older brother Las Vegas is, but still, that was super-dead for a bar. One review said it was super smoky, but I certainly didn't have that problem. It was fine to me. There wasn't really anyone even in there to smoke!\n\nNot a bad spot. May check it out again someday, seeing as it's right down the road.\n\nOh, one more note: People were complaining that Steelz is a \""gay bar\"" and it's like the downfall of good wholesome Henderson or some BS. Steelz is about as much a \""gay bar\"" as Del Taco is \""authentic Mexican\"" or Fox News is \""news.\"" Maybe it's gay-owned, gay-friendly and gay-welcoming, but it's not a gay bar. It's a bar.

"This was the most unexpectedly poor service flight I have ever experienced with Singapore Airlines, with whom I have flown over a 40+ year period. Flying business class on a 70 percent full plane meant the food service was over in less than 2 hours. So by 11.30 am GMT there was 11 more hours to landing. The cabin attendants were then very scant until 2 hours before landing. There was no fruit or chocolate available and snacks in galley limited to popcorn, chips and chicken wraps. No drinks other than bottles of water were distributed to passengers with main meal or laterin the flight. I am sure that this was not my expectation at all. The crew seemed very tired and waiting to get home to celebrate Eid. This was a such stark contrast other flights on this trip and felt like Business class was wasted on this leg.",positive,en
"I'm upgrading Warrender from 4 starts to 5 after a recent visit to the Commonwealth Pool. Where, I discovered, they have no sauna! SHORROR! (A mix of shock and horror in one, it saves time).\n\nSo Warrender is a neighbourhood, community pool. It's quite short (half the length of the Commonwealth I think). But I'm not coming here because I'm training for any race or endurance swim (hahahahaha). I come here for down time, to relax, for a leisurely half hour swim in which I do the head-above-the-water version of the breast stroke. And then want to relax for 10 minutes in the sauna after. And for that, Warrender is perfect.\n\nIt has one slow lane, one fast lane and the rest of the pool is open. Their timetable does vary day-on-day for open access. On a Saturday morning it's closed to general public until 10.30am as before that it's lessons and kids' hour. I only found this out at 10am when I arrived ready to swim, and had to wait half an hour. I was surrounded by babies in the watching area, who were all adorable, and then later on surrounded by half-damp over-excited children. But as soon as 10.30am came all the children left, and I was alone (for the most part) to relax and bob along.\n\nOne wee thing to note: you do now need to pay seperately for the sauna. It's \u00a31 for the band to get into the sauna. On top of the \u00a34.95 one-off swimming price, it can add up. But it's a once-a-week treat for me.\n\nSo Warrender, thank you for bringing the gorgeous warmth of a sauna in the midst of a Scottish winter closer to home.",positive,en

It may be easier if they pick one color of chalk for each type of beer, that way it is easy to find what you want. Or have #1-5 be one type of beer, #6-10 another and so on. My boyfriend spent so long trying to find a beer on the board because of this. Two of our friends were so overwhelmed with the way the selections were presented they just asked the server to surprise them with a choice. \n\nThe acoustics in the place are terrible.

Она ответила: ""А я вам все равно ничего показать не смогу потому что майские праздники начались. Поставщики отдыхают."" Но я не сказала , что мне линолиум нужен именно на майские праздники. Вобщем дала понять, чтоб мы отстали. Я осталась в шоке такая безинициативность, видимо она уже сама мысленно была на праздниках. А сам магазин не плохой. Живых продавцов бы туда.",negative,ru

"Quite possibly the most fun I've had in my entire life. Ghost bar, Playboy Club, and Rain were fun..and I guess I had fun at Moon, as well..but apparently my ass kept getting grabbed--so maybe it's a little creepy. I also wish they would have made me get down from the counter area where I was dancing, because I'm pretty sure I made a huge ass of myself..or just showed it to everyone. Had fun at all of them..especially at the Playboy Club! Played a lot of black jack... dealers were nice, personable, and even helped me out a bit. Too bad by the end of the night I was blacked out and don't even remember what I did with my chips. \n\n24/7 is disgusting, do NOT eat there. I can't comment on the buffet, as I was too hungover to actually eat. I went to Little Buddha, which is a Japanese AND Chinese restaurant.. saw some famous poker players there? My roll was icky, but I should have read the description better (which told me it was wrapped in cucumber--which was why it was icky for me). Chuka salad was delish, and the sushi pieces were some of the best I've ever had. The server gave me a hard time about charging the bill to my room, which was annoying. (It was in my brother's name) \n\nWai Mei is my brother's host, and she was more than helpful for my entire visit (got me on the list for all of the clubs). The room was delightful.. 2 queen beds (which was good b/c there were 3 girls), I melted into the sheets like butter on a hot pan, and the bathroom was more than accomodating for all 3 of us (and me on Sunday morning when I was hungover as hell). \n\nThe pool is gorgeous.. however, it was cold, so I didn't really get to enjoy it. I just laid out there and fell asleep.",neutral,en

"So we finally went there for lunch today. The decor and everything was really nice, the bar area was big, a lot of dining space and a sushi bar. They also have an upsairs but the staircase looked to be under consturction still. \n\nI'm going to go ahead and get right to the food though. The main conclusion....we're still hungry.\n\nWe got the bento box which came with a dish, rice, spring roll, and salad. The dressing on the salad was really good, and I did enjoy the spring roll.\n\nI got the Thai Basil Chicken. It looked really good and it wasn't bad but it didn't taste like thai chicken to me. I don't know if it's cause they used a soy garlic sauce but when I think of thai I think of a sauce with coconut milk. It could have been much better. No, it should have been much better.\n\nMy friend also got a bento box. She go the General Tzu's Chicken but with brown rice, which also has a $1 extra charge for, as well as fried rice. Well....we don't think the rice was actually brown. It looks like white rice that was turned brown and fried with eggs. She even asked the waiter to make sure it was actually brown rice and he said yes. Definitely not a healthy option if that's what you're looking for so don't bother with it. It's a waste of the $1. But that's not it, the chicken was just not good. It was so bland and flavorless and quite disappointing. It probably ruined the whole box experience. I don't think she was very happy with her meal at all.\n\nFrom their menu it looks like AZN is trying to get a decent mix of different Asian styles on their menu. But most of what we had really lacked in flavor and that's what makes Asian food so great. So if you want reasonably priced Chinese food that's still really good, you're better off going to Baoding. And to get much better Thai food, go to Deejai Thai. Both much better and highly recommended options.\n\nI was hoping this place would be great, mainly because of it's convenience but honestly I'm not sure if I want to go back any time soon. I know it's still new and they probably have a few kinks to work out so I'm not ruling it out completely. And I am still curious about their sushi so I'll be going back. I'm just not in a rush.",negative,en

"I have stayed at the Hotel Contessa five times, and I continue to enjoy it each time. Its lovely decor, and its nice welcome at the front door. The rooms are suites which allow you to spread out and feel at home. Again, the suites have a nice decor. There is a living area, a large sized bathroom, a bar/makeup area (granite counter top and mirror), and separate bedroom. There is a roof top pool, spa, and fitness area. The bar/restaurant is in a lovely atrium area that leads directly on to the Riverwalk. Enjoyed sitting in the lounge area while eating their good food. A great location for enjoying the Riverwalk. It is quiet ...most of the time.
In addition, the public areas of the hotel have a wonderful fragrance. It is so nice each time I go near the elevator on the Riverwalk level, I inhale deeply to enjoy.. See if you do.

"Me and my wife enjoyed a two-night stay here during one of the busiest tourism weeks in NYC, between Christmas and New Year's.
We found the hotel pretty easily using the GPS, and parked our car in the garage directly across the street. The garage is not owned by the hotel, however you get a discounted rate if staying there (just be sure to have your parking ticket validated before you leave); total cost to park was $70 over the 2 days. Check in was a breeze and we made our way up to our room on the 18th floor, where we found a standard size hotel room for NYC (small). Best part of the room was the fantastic view of the Empire State Building, which is only a block away.
As is standard with Hampton Inns, there is a complimentary breakfast available, which includes both hot and cold breakfast items. Unfortunately, this was not a great experience here. Extremely crowded and busy, which lead to a very chaotic scene and few available options (seemed like the staff was not ready and replenishing). Fortunately though, this was really the only negative experience about our stay (that, and the fact that traffic outside was a bit noisy at times, but that is expected given it is NYC).
I have stayed at many Hampton Inns, and have generally enjoyed them because they tend to be modern hotels with no overkill, and good value. Value is of course subjective and the hotel is certainly pricey, but that is to be expected given it's excellent location right in the heart of midtown Manhattan. We were able to walk around and see a lot of the city from the location though, and there is a metro train stop right outside of the hotel.
Overall, it's a good hotel and I'd stay here again.",positive,en

"My husband and I were getting kind of tired of big heavy meals so we decided sandwiches would be a nice break. I am a very light eater so we decided to share a sandwich, bowl of soup and potato salad. We got the New York Mile High on marble rye with potato salad and chicken noodle soup. When I first took a bite of the soup I told my husband it was probably the best non-homemade chicken noodle soup I've ever had. That alone would have made me happy. But then I took a bite of the sandwich. OMG! It was heaven! The corned beef is perfectly seasoned and the combination with the coleslaw is perfect! We both decided that this was the best sandwich we'd ever had! They're huge so sharing is no problem. The potato salad was great too. These guys definitely know what they're doing! My biggest complaint now is that I'm back home, 2000 miles away from Vegas, and I'm already craving the mile high!!",positive,en

"A very pleasant 4 day stay in one of the best located hotels in the City. Considering the very cheap rate we paid it would be hard to offer many crticisms. The staff were always helpful - in particular Bob the concierge gave great advice for tours and places to eat. Nearby cafes provided close access and affordable meals - La Taza in particular also provided great latino pop music as a soundtrack to the multi cultural city that is San Fran. The rooms were spacious but a little dated though clean. we had a room overlooking Post Street and as a couple of previous reviews have noted , noise can be a problem. Garbage collection in particular from the premises opposite was a problem around 11pm. We were tired after a 4 week trip and probably could have slept through a rock concert but I would suggest that a room at the rear of the hotel would be a far better option for any future visits.",negative,en
"Most important thing first – this is a review of the Hilton CLUB New York, which is on the 37th and 38th floors of the Hilton New York. It is a timeshare but when not in use by owners the rooms are available to paying guests.
The location is great – a few blocks from Central Park/Carnegie Hall/Radio City, and not very far from Times Square. Given we didn’t have a car seat we got the subway from JFK, which was actually a really easy journey, and not much slower than a cab. Apart from the E train there wasn’t a useful (to us!) subway line on the doorstep, but there are a few within a few blocks.
We (me, wife and 2 year old daughter) stayed in a studio for 1 night, and a 1 bedroom suite for 4 nights. The studio was quite a bit larger than the average New York hotel, and the one bedroom was a great size for the three of us. The beds were very comfortable and the bathroom was nice, with Aveda toiletries. One downside was that there was no bath, only a shower, which wasn’t so good for my daughter (and no swimming pool in the hotel, which she would have liked!). The only other downside was the lack of catering facilities – there was a coffee machine in-room and a fridge (which we couldn’t get to stay cold) but it would have been nice to have a microwave.
There was free internet access, but we had to re-enter the code every 8 minutes, which was a bit irritating (I think that this was a problem, rather than being a normal feature!).
There is also a lounge which doubles up as the check-in desk – all the staff were great, a real credit to the organisation. Included in the price, and served in the lounge, is breakfast (not a hot breakfast, but a good range of cereals, pastries, bagels, fruit, yoghurt, boiled eggs etc.). There is a daily “manager’s reception” in the evening with wine, beer and soft drinks, and finger food. Nothing to write home about, and we only made it a couple of times given that there was so much of New York to see!
We were checking out of the Hilton Club into the Hilton New York, so they gave us free bag storage, otherwise there is a charge.
All in all we loved it so much that we bought a timeshare there – so I guess we’ll be back for the next 21 years :-)",negative,en

"For the cost, the hotel is a great value. It is close to the space needle and the Key Area. We had read other reviews that said it was centrally located in downtown - and we didn't quite agree with that.
First of all, the room was OK - we got a room on the first floor right off from the lobby. The staff at the hotel was accomadating and helpful. For the price, this hotel was a good find for us. We are young newlyweds who didn't want to spend a fortune to stay in Seattle for the weekend.
The only downside for us was the distance from the city. It took us about 20-25 minutes to walk from the Pike Place Market to the hotel. We needed the exercise, so it wasn't a big problem, but we weren't under the impression (from the hotel website and other reviews) that the hotel that far from downtown (when you read other reviews that say 'centrally located', that's not what we pictured).
I will say that the hotel is in a nicer neighborhood. I have stayed closer to Belltown several times for work, and have been weery of walking alone, but I didn't feel that way this time.",positive,en

"Dear friends, I've never seen such a trash movie as NIGHT OF THE DEMONS (1988). It seems that the director Kevin Tenney had the intention to copy classics like THE EVIL DEAD by Sam Raimi (1978) or George A. Romero's RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD from the same year. The cinematography was lousy, the movie was very dark, so I had to turn the brightness control to the maximum. Indeed, horror pictures have to be dark, but not the way like NIGHT OF THE DEMONS. The entire movie was ridiculous, no suspense, worse actors except Alvin Alexis in the role of Rodger, and horrible make-up effects. An average vote of 5 stars for that movie? I can't believe this. Perhaps the users were pleased about the tits, asses and pussies of the actresses, they were indeed worth 5 stars. Regards, Hans-Dieter",negative,en

"As you walk past the food stalls you're accosted by young women waitresses who show you the fish, weigh it, and suggest preparation methods. We were shown some whole pomfret as the best quality fish. It struck me as a bit large for two people but the waitress assured me it was just right. We also ordered a small portion of their fern shoots (midin) in garlic and char kway teow noodles. When the food arrived it was obvious that there was enough for six people. I should have paid more attention to the actual weight of the fish - about 100gm per person. And even the small fern shoot dish would have fed an army. Unfortunately pomfret don't come in 200 gm sizes. Fortunately the investment isn't great it just seems like such a waste.",neutral,en

Gate to hotel is locked at 7pm, so you have to walk around the entrance to the parking lot to get off the property. Pool was very small and dirty ashtrays littered the area. The Jungle Room bar looked like a regular hotel bar. No entertainment at the hotel.

"Guided by previous reviews, I was expecting something really special from this hotel.
We booked one of the ""Prestige Suites"" directly through Sofitel. These rooms are all at the front of the hotel. We were on Floor 8 of 14. Don't expect much of a view.
There is major refurbishing work going on directly opposite the hotel ,so expect noise from 7am onwards (mainly from rubbish being thrown into the back of skips from a great height).
No warning or mention of this inconvenience anywhere on the hotel website.
This work looks like going on for many months yet.
One bedroom suites are large, clean and chilled with a huge bathroom and plenty of wardrobe space, with loads of gadgets like a Bose sound system that I never worked out how to operate.
On the whole, the reception staff seem to feel that they have that air of superiority.
Continential breakfast included in the price was hugely disappointing. This consisted of two croissants and a slice of bread per person with fruit juice and tea/coffee. We were expecting cereal as well as cold meats/cheese like at other hotels, but this was all extra. Be aware that the ""a la carte"" breakfast during the week could turn out to be very expensive.",negative,en

"Pretty good film from Preminger; labyrinthine at times, as it explores sets and locales from various angles and perspectives as if it were a nature film on the denizens of the modern city and how they live. In this sense it is visually and spatially satisfying, as its hero, a good cop with a bad temper, gets into very hot water when he accidentally kills a guy with a plate in his head.Dana Andrews plays the lead as if it were Hamlet, and has never been better. The story may be pure melodrama but Andrews gives it weight, and almost raises it to the level of tragedy. As his girl, Gene Tierney is attractive but unremarkable. Gary Merrill makes for a very interesting villain, with his natural warmth providing a nice contrast to Andrews' coolness; his smiling, amiable-seeming bad guy seems to be continually challenging his nemesis by the mere fact of his being emotionally open, as opposed to the tightly wound and moralistic cop who is pursuing him. There are no major surprises in this film, which seems transitional for all concerned. For director Preminger it is a reunion of sorts with his Laura stars, Andrews and Tierney, who were passing their career peaks at around the time the movie was made. The supporting cast,--Merrill, Karl Malden, Neville Brand--are, understandably, more optimistic, as they were all on their way up. Preminger, as serene an observer as ever, lets the events unfold without expressing a strong point of view, as the morally ambiguous ending is somewhat disappointing, for the cat and mouse game between the two antagonists seems larger and more archetypal than any mere movie could contain, much less resolve.",positive,en

Also, because of that ""no window"" situation, we had to overheat the room cause all the cold air from outside was coming in. And finally, the pressure in the shower was quite low and it was taking us 30min to be able to wash ourselves.

"Believe the hype.\n\nFOOD: The SHRIMP AND GRITS were outstanding. Perfectly cooked shrimp resting in a bed of (cheesy?) grit goodness. The grits are soft and compliment the tender shrimp and eggs. I knew there was a slice of bacon at the bottom of the bowl and I considered asking for my bacon on the side. Yes, I have no shame. But I forgot and I'm so glad I did. The soft thick bacon added texture and salt to the lovely dish.What was the seasoning on the grits? I am embarrassed to say that I didn't slow down enough to think about it. I tried to savor the meal, but ended up demolishing everything on my plate in record time. \n\nI wish I could say that I'll try a number of other dishes during future visits. But I won't. I have fallen in love (maybe deep like) and have very little desire to explore the rest of the (intriguing) menu. \n\nIf you are unsure about the commitment to quality in this place, keep an eye out for the owner. I saw her wave and chat with a few tables and then go right back to the business of keeping on eye on service and food. In the short time I was there, I saw her giving instruction to a waiter struggling (or so it seemed) with a larger table, checking the hollandaise sauce, and preparing a few plates.\n\nSERVICE: The service was excellent. The host didn't give us an accurate (on any level) wait time, but he was warm. Our waitress was friendly and attentive. That's all I need. \n\nVIBE: Earthy, eclectic hipster with an edge\n\nEXCUSES: You've already read about the negatives--it can be loud, the meter situation is a hassle, and there will be a wait. But the food is worth it. The city could start construction on Carson and I'd just wear comfy shoes and walk a ways to get to those shrimp and grits. \n\nIf this is where the Vegas food scene is headed (quality ingredients, playful offerings, delicious food, good customer service, community atmosphere), I am excited to support the businesses leading the charge. I'll be back to eat.",positive,en

"Originating from Asia I am a huge fan of bubble tea and have visited and tried almost every places in Madison that has bubble tea on their menu. Being centrally located close to campus I have visited Steepery plenty of times since they first opened about 2 years ago. I like how they use authentic tea (black or green) in their beverages; I can always taste the tea in every sip. They are also very good at customizing every beverage you order (sugar level, ice etc). I have tried black tea, green tea as well as their shakes and fruit smoothies. My favorite by far are still the traditional classics -- taro black tea and matcha green tea. For smoothies, the pina colada offers a refreshing feeling especially for the summer \n\nThe only thing I avoid are, sadly, their bubbles, after several occasions of having bubbles that were not cooked all the way -- soft on the outside and hard on the inside. This is pretty unfortunate as the chewy bubbles are an integral part of bubble teas. I haven't gone back to try their bubbles again in a while now, so I am not sure if they are more consistent. \n\nI still visit Steepery often for their teas or smoothies, just that I order my beverages without bubbles.

"With our daughter attending college in Baltimore, my husband and I are regular visitors to the city, always enjoying our time. We decided to try the Intercontinental this trip based on the Inner Harbor location and our experience with other Intercontinental hotels. Our room here was a mixed bag.
Following an early flight, there were a variety of rooms available, so we were able to check in early instead of having our luggage held. We were given the opportunity to upgrade our room to a waterfront view, however we declined as $50 plus taxes seemed high. This is where we should have followed advice from tripadvisor posters who had recommended the water view rooms. What I didn’t realize was that by not upgrading, our room faced a wall which I found to be a bit claustrophobic. I had also requested a quiet room away from the elevator, but our room was in the inner courtyard so we were closest to the elevator on our floor. This meant we not only heard the elevator clanking all night, but also heard a noisy group of guests coming and going in the hallway. I had planned on requesting a different room for our second night, however, we had early morning plans (and a train to catch) with our daughter, and the front desk was busy that morning. I slept with earplugs both nights. The next morning there were food bits outside of our door I had to step over.
The positives on the room were that the bed was very comfortable and the room itself was spotless. The bathroom and shower were excellent with good water pressure.
I swim whenever possible, but here I was only able to swim the second morning as the pool doesn’t open until 8am on weekends. I was glad to get to use the pool as it felt wonderful after a day of walking. The pool is not huge, but it is very attractive with a designated lap lane. A couple negatives - the hot tub was not working and dirty towels from the day before were piled up. The fitness area looked excellent and with warmer weather, there is also a sunning area outside the pool.
The location is fantastic for enjoying the Inner Harbor. You have to cross Light Street (which is 6 lanes), but the Science Center is across the street, so there is a crosswalk. We had a drink at the Rusty Scupper, less than a five minute walk and enjoyed a superb harbor view while we watched the boats come in.
We opted for the self –parking for $26/day. You take an elevator down to the lobby and then cross the driveway and take another elevator for the garage. It is not as convenient as the valet service ($48/day), but it was fine for us and we were in and out quite a bit. One perk is that you can use the lot all day after you check out, so we enjoyed the harbor right until we left for the airport.
The staff we encountered was professional and when asked about our room, we were given a credit for the Internet charge. We had breakfast at Illy Café in the lobby – great coffee and some healthy breakfast options (try the Greek yogurt, fruit, and granola).
Our room situation left me feeling like this was a mixed bag – otherwise my rating would have been higher.",positive,en
"I couldn't be happier to see another Bndz location! It's great to not have to trek through South Park to get one of my favorite burgers and fries. Furthermore, this location seems to be more open and spacious.\n While out and about in Mt. lebo, I called in my order and took my food to go. I immediately began to compare the new Bndz to my beloved South Park location. Overall, the food was spot on. The burgers were cooked to perfection. The fries were crispy and delicious. My only gripe would be that they seemed to skimp a little on the fries. When you add on the fry and drink combo it's another $3. The burgers are already about 10-12$ each so, a little pricey to start. Therefore, if I'm paying 15$ for a burger and fries, I do expect to have a good size helping of those delicious fried sticks. \nFries aside, my favorite aspect of Bndz is the emphasis on quality, hormone free meat. The ingredients are always fresh and of a higher quality than most. Have you tried the chicken bacon burger? Yes, it is diced chicken but, it's much tastier than the typical, dried out chicken breast most places call a burger. Overall, I'm thrilled to welcome Bndz to the growing restaurant scene in Mt. Lebo.",positive,en

"I thought Eddie's House was just ok in all facets. Our server was really nice, but she forgot about all of our sides. We were all mostly finished with our meals before they came out. My meal was just plain weird. I appreciate the chef's creativity, but what I ordered simply didn't work. It was the ginger/sesame ahi tuni with artichokes, feta (basically all mediterrean flavors) over thin spagetti. I love all of these ingredients - and even love them together, but the big hunk of ahi should've been sliced (it was hard to carve through) and the pasta was overcooked, which I think is a rookie mistake. It all kind mushed together into a pretty unpleasant plate. My colleague ordered one of Eddie's signature dishes, the \""what's in the steak\"" steak. Since this client was a new friend, I didn't ask to try his food, but he said that he enjoyed it. Basically, its a filet mignon encased in a big ball of mashed potatoes and then deep fried. OMG. When it came out it was about as big as my head. Other's had assorted fish dishes and the lamb, which they seemed to like. The sides were grilled sparagus with balsamic, which was yummy, but not very creative or innovative, sugar snap peas (which never made it to the table) and the procuitto mac n cheese. The mac and cheese was good, but not nearly as good as other mac n cheese dishes I've had. Like I said, Eddie seems to have a very cool culinary mind, but execution wise wasn't as good as it could've been.",negative,en

"My son and I had problems finding a twin room in N.Y. at an affordable price. We had 3 nights at this hotel (then did a tour) then returned for 1 night.
The room was clean but basic (we shared bathroom - that was clean too) and tiny. I've never stayed in such a small hotel room before. Twin beds, 1 against each wall, small dresser in the middle, hanging space, sink and the room was filled.
The room was very hot but we couldn't have the air-con on as it was far too loud when sleeping.
The location was the best thing - it's a great spot to see Manhatten and yes, we had a view of the Empire State building on the final night (if you looked up past the brick wall outside the window).

"I recently travelled with Singapore Airlines to Singapore/London from Sydney and return. Whilst flights SQ242 and SQ221 were reasonable my flights SQ306 and SQ321 between Singapore and London were dreadful.
I am a pensioner, doing occasional casual work, and it has taken quite a while to save up for this trip. As I have arthritis and I'm 75 years old, I persuaded my travelling companion to book premium economy. On previous trips, with Cathay and Air Canada, I had been upgraded to premium economy and found it to be much more comfortable than being in economy.
I cannot understand why Singapore Airlines thinks that the Boeing 777 is suitable for premium economy, and I feel exploited. The seating was so cramped that you could hardly get out of your seat to reach the aisle. When the person in front reclined their seat movement was almost impossible. How is this better than economy?
On the flight over my t.v. screen malfunctioned for 3 hours and I could not watch anything!! The flight crew did everything they could to fix it and after all that time they finally did.
On the return flight I could not recline my seat which made it very uncomfortable trying to sleep.
Additionally, on this flight, the middle toilet seemed to be out of use, so we had to walk to the very rear of the plane. In fact, we had to walk further to a toilet than anyone else on the plane! I was very unimpressed given the huge amount of money we paid for premium economy.
I have been fortunate to have travelled several times in my life, and this experience with Singapore Airlines was the worst travel experience I have had with an airline. This is more so because I expected more, given the amount I and my friend paid for premium economy. I did expect it to be better than economy.
I might also add that when I tried to log in to Kris Flyer in the plane I could not do so.
Almost everything was unsatisfactory but the very cramped space and poor value for the dollar were the worst. Given that Singapore Airlines was recently named as the world’s top airline, I would have to strongly disagree. My only positive opinion relates to the ease of checking in and the pleasantness of the flight crew.
Singapore Airlines has not replied to my last email, which I guess is what you would expect!",negative,en

"Okay, let me just start out and say that rarely do ANY of my reviews go from 1 Star to 5 Stars in the course of one visit. However in the instance of my recent visit, this is definitely the case. Please preface my earlier review before continuing...\n\nSo after enduring my last miserable experience with iPic, I was contacted by a customer service rep, then I was put in contact with a local manager named Lawrence (Larry). Larry apologized for the instance and said he just wanted to make it right & I was very appreciative of that. He offered to have my tickets reimbursed, for which I was also very appreciative. He took down my information: address, phone number. I then waited for my passes in the mail, but to no avail. Many months pass by, still no passes. \n\nBecause I have recently been making a transition to the valley, I was in town last week checking up on my new home build. I then, once again decided to readdress the issue with the hope of some final resolution.\nI called during the day and reached a manager named Brian Vogel. I explained my situation about my \""lost in translation\"" phone call with Lawrence and my previous horrible experience with Phil & Justin then Brian said he would call me back. 5 minutes later Brian called me & apologized for Larry's mishandling of the situation & my previous experience & offered to make it right with passes. Brian went above and beyond and provided me with his direct number in the case all was not satisfactory on my next visit.\n\nFast forward to later on that week. I treated my family to the new Farrely Brothers movie, \""Dumb and Dumber To\"". There were six of us & I used the three free passes on the event. \n\nMy other two family members that hadn't been back since our incident with Phil & Justin (Heckle & Jeckle) were present with me and were very happy with the renewed experience. Our waitress Alesse was very kind and tentative with our drinks and food orders and we ended up having a fantastic time!\n\nUnfortunately I wasn't able to meet the fantastic Manager Brian Vogel in person that night (because the movie played later in the night), but I definitely look forward to it in the future. I want to shake his hand & tell him thank you!!!!\n\nAlso, if you get a chance Yelpers, if you've also enjoyed a great experience at this theater, Brian deserves props. Please let him know.

No sauce no onions or veggies. Nothing much stood out. 2/5 overall\n\nThe restaurant itself was lacking in ambiance. Very cafeteria-esque. Too bright.

غاية في الإحباط بعد أن أقمنا هنا من قبل وعانينا من الخدمة الشنيعة بعد الافتتاح مباشرة، فكرنا أن نمنح فندق موزاييك فرصة أخرى في العام التالي على أمل أن يكون قد تحسن. ولكن لسوء الحظ، أصبحت الخدمة أكثر سوءا من ذي قبل، وهو أمر يدعو إلى الإحساس بالخزي والعار لهذا الفندق الملاصق لفندق أبو تيج مارينا الشهير بمنطقة الجونة. حينما وصلنا إلى الفندق، بدأت الإجراءات البطيئة كالسلحفاة متبوعة بظهور رجل رث الهيئة يعرض علينا مرافقتنا إلى غرفتنا للتحقق من وجود الفراش الكبير الذي قمنا بحجزه ودفعنا ثمنه عبر الإنترنت وأكدنا على تاريخ الوصول ولكن خاب أملنا حيث وجدنا بدلا منه غرفة مزدوجة. وحينما اتصلنا بمكتب الاستقبال لنشكو من ذلك، كان العاملون به غير ودودين وغير متعاونين. كان جهاز التليفزيون أيضا لا يعمل الأمر الذي لم يكن يشكل في العادة مشكلة كبيرة سوى إننا كنا قد أتينا من رحلة طويلة وعانينا من تأخر الطائرة ولم نجد أي عزاء طوال الليل. وبعد عدة مكالمات نستجدي فيها أن يغيروا لنا الغرفة، عرض علينا موظف الاستقبال الانتقال إلى جناح الأمر الذي أسعدنا للحظات قليلة قبل أن نكتشف أنه مجرد دعوة للانتقال إلى مكان أكثر تكلفة على حسابنا بالطبع. وما زاد الطين بلة أن موظف الاستقبال حينما أخبرناه بأننا سوف نغادر الفندق أخبرنا بأن نقودنا لن ترد. إن الكلمات لا تكفي للتعبير عن مدى غضبنا من كيفية التعامل مع طاقم غير كفؤ حيث شعرنا بأنه تم التغرير بنا ولم نحصل على ما دفعنا لأجل الحصول عليه. يا له من أمر مشين,negative,ar

The prices are reasonable (relatively speaking; Phoenix, y'all don't seem to realize how expensive your thrifts are) and I usually find something interesting here. There are often antiques or vintage items in the display, but be prepared to pay antique store prices for them. There is a small selection of furniture at the front of the store, and more utilitarian items towards the back. The staff is helpful and there is one little lady who is especially pleasant; every time I see her she has a kind word for me, and that has no price tag. They have some sort of special nearly every day, so great discounts are to be had. This place is in a nearly dead strip mall on a busy intersection and competes with several antique stores (who probably sourced more than a few items from here), so give it a look.

"When it was released this film caused a sensation. I watched it and was thrilled. Beautiful, usually young, naked women filmed in the classy style we knew so well from director Hamiltons photography. His photographs never become porn and the same is true for this movie. Today I saw it again and was bitterly disappointed. The soft core in extremely slow paced scenes, all filmed with some Vaseline on the lenses, actually is all there is. There is no real story, the characters remain beautiful and beautifully filmed bodies, but they are not real creatures with a soul. Actually nothing happens. It is like Hamilton is photographing using moving pictures rather than stills. And this gets so boring after a while. I even didn't watch the whole thing the second time, for I fell vast asleep. That is all that remains of this masterpiece: it is a very good sleeping pill. And you will never become addicted to it!Back then 7 out of 10, now 3 out of 10",negative,en

However, I needed my puppies booster shots anyways.\nI waited longer than I wanted to but, oh well, this seems to be the norm at doctors offices be it human or pet.\nThe vet tech and the vet were both super friendly and explained everything in complete detail to me. Very sympathetic and attentive to my needs. I think the tech had told the vet my rantings of the previous vet experience I had. \n\nAll in all, I am going to go back. The vet did assure me that I would be able to get the chip in both of my dogs without paying visit fees since I already paid them when I went the day they told me to. Thankfully!",neutral,en

This is the easiest and by far the cheapest mode of transportation to various places on the strip.\n\nThe dealers in the casino were very friendly and helpful.

"Just came back after a free night here using my SPG hotel points. The biggest problem with this hotel is its location. Their Acura drop-off service is a joke and no taxis will come to this area on weekend unless a hotel guest is arriving back to the hotel and taxi agrees to take you. The hotel is 1.5 blocks inside a main street with nothing but construction going on. The hotel is OK for weekday business crowd who are staying for business in downtown financial district. If you are arriving here for weekend (or weekday) stay for NYC attractions, look elsewhere unless you are getting a free night with your hotel points and all other starwood hotels in prime spots in NYC are not available. We had to wait 15 minutes for a taxi and I can see guests waiting for longer than 30 minutes during peak evening times to get one. It is about $18-19 each way from here to time square area by taxi. The contruction noise was not an issue for us as the contruction was not taking place on Sunday morning and it was raining, but I can see that as a problem also as noted by previous reviewers.

"Im a statistician, not a programmer. There is so much detail and explanation about the statistics and concepts behind how it works, but there is hardly ever an actual lesson on the code used or needed to implement the algorithms. When trying to fumble my way through the code, I found, on several occasions, the code in the self-directed lessons to be incomplete (Im referring to pieces of code that were obviously meant to be there, but were missing), causing hours and hours of anguish and turmoil. I feel like there should be a lot more time spent on the actual coding and learning how to implement it within the code (similar to the 1st course), rather than spending an exuberant amount of time going through derivations and no time on actual coding and how to implement it within the programming language.If you are a software designer/engineer or programmer, then you should be fine as long as you pay attention to the very long lessons and derivations and can fix the broken code that you are given. There are other mistakes within the quizzes as well, which make them near impossible to pass. For example, it is unclear which model you need to use to calculate in order to get the correct square foot. On other occasions, the question actually specifies to use the model from (3), whereas it actually wants you to use the model from (4) instead to get the correct answer. This course needs to have better quality checks to ensure needlessly lost time is minimized.",negative,en

"On arrival, the Pennyslvania lobby looks impressive - but the queue for check-in and the less than helpful check-in staff, set the tone for what was to come! There were at least 40 people in the queue in front of us, and not one member of hotel staff attempting to establish who was checking in or who was checking out, or helping to speed up the process. Nearing the check-in desk (at 1 pm), after at least a 35 minute wait, the couple in front of us informed us that this was their second attempt to check-in that day, as they had been brusquely told earlier they couldn't check-in until 3 pm. (The sign indicating this was behind the desk some way away from those in the queue, and not mentioned in my booking documentation).
Our check-in clerk looked like she really didn't want to be there, made no attempt to apologise for the delay, and informed us we couldn't check in (as no twin rooms were clean) unless we wanted a king-size room instead. If we didn't want that, then we would have to PAY $4 per case for the left luggage! We took the room.
The corridor to our room... the room door... the room... well, what can I say. It reminded me of a haunted house... dark and dingy grey (although there was evidence of someone attempting to paint along the corridor). The room door looked like it came off a coffin. The room had NO natural light and was old fashioned in the extreme. The bathroom wasn't much better - a broken light, a hairdryer with a plug which had clearly blown some time ago, no plug in the bath....
There was no Wifi connection (free or otherwise) in the hotel - a 'given' these days in lots of decent hotels - unless you went to the internet room on the ground floor. No tea/coffee facilities in the room. No wardrobe. A large black mark on the carpet beside the bed which looked like a tin of black shoe polish had been spilt there.
The one and ONLY plus for this hotel is its location, smack opposite Penn Station and Madison Square Garden on 7th Avenue and round the corner from the Empire State Building.
Having said that I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone and will not be darkening its doors again.

"평점 4.05, 재방문의 사 70 직장인들이 좋아할 만한 핫플레이스 맛 집. 건물 외관만 봐도 맛 집의 포스가 풀풀 풍기는 곳이다. 게다가 점심시간에 가도 사람들이 줄 서서 먹을 정도로 굉장히 인기가 많은 곳이다. 먹기도 전에 맛이 있을 수밖에 없는 포스를 자랑하며, 기대감을 증폭시키는 곳이었다. 메뉴도 생각보다 많지 않았다. 수제비, 칼국수 류에 덮밥류까지, 내 기준에 맛있어 보이는 메뉴에 집중하려는 모습이 보이는 곳이다. 내가 주문한 건 김치 수제비! 다른 테이블에서는 칼국수도 많이 드시고 계셨지만, 나는 김치 수제비를 피했다. 일단 한 뚝배기의 양이 엄청나다. 먹기도 전에 든든함이 느껴지는 양이었고, 재료도 아낌없이 넣었다는 걸 온몸으로 과시하는 듯한 비주얼을 자랑한다. 바지락 껍데기만 앞접시를 가득 채울 정도로 넣어주신다. 여기서 가장 중요한 포인트는 바로 김치다. 김치가 세상 제일 맛있는 것 같다. 이제 막 담근 김치, 겉절이를 가장 좋아하는 나는 여기 김치를 안 좋아할 리가 없다.먹는 순간 김치 수제비를 시킨 걸 후회했고, 칼국수에 김치를 얹어서 먹는 테이블이 왜 이렇게 납득할 만한 맛이었다. 이 집은 음식도 맛있지만 가히 김치 맛 집이라고 해도 과언이 아니다. 그만큼 김치가 최고이다. 심지어 어디서 납품? 하는지 물어보고 우리 집으로 납품받고 싶을 정도... 최종적으로 신사역 주위에서 만날 수 있는 직장인 점심 맛 집이란 걸 단번에 알 수 있었고, 망고 플레이트 평점이 높은 이유도 어렵지 않게 납득할 수 있었다. 그리고 김치는 최고이다.",positive,ko

"After trying their Salsa, Guacamole and Ceviche at the Yelp Event, I couldn't get it out of my mind, it was so good, so I went to have lunch here today! \n\nLet me tell you How Amazing our food was!!! \n\nTo start I ordered the custom Guacamole, they give you a list of ingredients and you check which ones you would like, I chose everything except onions and word to the wise, do yourself a favor and make sure you get the pomegranates (see pics) \nWOW OH WOW, that was the Best Guacamole I've ever had, seriously!!! \n\nFor my entree I decided to order the Acapulco Shrimp Ceviche (see pics) \nIt was Delicious just like it was at the event. \n\nI also ordered the Chicken Taquitos (see pics) OMGosh! These were absolutely the highlight of the meal, definitely not what I was expecting and I mean that in the best way possible! \nFreshly stuffed with shredded chicken and bacon and then rolled and fried to a golden crisp, yet they were so delicate and flavorful. \nI would go here again and again just to order these babies! \n\nMy hubby ordered their cheese enchiladas with two fried eggs on top, which they were more than willing to accommodate him with even though it was not on the menu. (Sorry No pics), but he LOVED every bite, only problem was he wished they had been served with a bit more of their tasty charro beans. \n\nAnd despite getting the generous discount card from the event last night (get $15 off $40) We didn't even hit $40 dollars ordering all that! I think their prices are very fair, especially for the quality and amount of food. \n\nMy only complaint was, the place was still Bombay Spice-ish, decor and music wise. -1 star \n\n\nPlease go get some decorations to liven up the place and give it some character along with playing some more fitting music, I'm not talking mariachi or anything but some Island beats would have been better suited than Loungey dance music. \n\n**The Food was a definite 5 stars for me though**",neutral,en

"I have no idea as to which audience director George Schlatter hoped to sell this comedy-of-ills. With Redd Foxx in the central role and enough pimpy outfits and polyester to carpet the entire 1970s, ""Norman"" plays like a blaxploitation picture combined with any number of silly sitcom episodes involving comic misunderstandings, not to mention an elongated cameo by Waylon Flowers! Based on a play by Sam Bobrick and Ron Clark, this tale of an estranged married couple (Foxx and Pearl Bailey) learning the hard way that their son is secretly gay--and living with a mincing, prancing white homosexual--has enough limp-wristed jokes to shame any early episode of ""Three's Company"". Bailey keeps her dignity, and Foxx's sheer confusion is good for a couple of chuckles, but the rest of the performers are humiliated. * from ****",negative,en

"I love this place. The enchiladas in green tomatillo are superb, the tomatillo is more sour and spicy (which I love), but using the cheese they do balances out the flavors. They have great beans and rice. But, my personal favorite has to be huevos rancheros. I have a hard time ordering anything else. \n\nI visited Restaurant Mexico the night before last with a friend who was craving Mexico City style. We were fully satisfied. What we didn't realize is that we came in just before closing. But, we didn't feel rushed at all. In fact, they refilled our bowl of chips and salsa when the food came out. \n\nI've lived in Mexico City and the flavors here are the closest I've found in Phoenix to the food I would eat there. This in mind, the sauces accent the flavors of the chiles and tomatoes more simply and without sugar. Sour and bitter flavors can be part of the overall allure of these type of sauces, hence the \""watery\"" salsa that comes out with the chips. It is a simple tomato and chile salsa without frills, but that is the style. \n\nThe only complaint I have is the enchiladas are a traditional small size. That said, I could probably eat a platter full.",positive,en

Not necessarily a bad thing, as it leaves more room sampling the 18 (or so) varieties of tasty morsels the small army of servers will bring to your table when you have your \""feed me!\"" chip turned to display the appropriate signal. Our experience was that everyone at the table was offered a portion, regardless of the yes/no position, as long as at least one person had signaled for more.\n\nThis is not the place for a quick meal. Take your time and savor. They make a pretty decent Caipirinha in the bar.\n\nThey lose half a star because the music from the bar (apparently very popular) competed a little bit with our dinner conversation.

"The hotel is pleasant enough but this still does not excuse the fact that $400 was taken from our room. I was told by management that this was the first time that something like this had happened in the hotel but looking through previous reviews I see that another person experienced the same thing.
Unfortunately the day the money taken from the room, was my second last day in the hotel. I had been keeping my cash in the safe but because I had entered the safe code wrong, the day the money was taken, I had decided to leave the safe open for fear I'd not be able to open it again.
I had left the room earlier that day, my travel companion remained in the room. Before he left he told one of the room service girls that there was a plumping issue in the bathroom. She said she'd contact reception and she would get someone to the room to look after it.
On checking to see how much money we had left for our last day in New York, we found that our money was down $400- there is not a shadow of doubt in my mind, the money had been taking by a member of hotel staff.
We spoke we the receptionist straight away on discovering the money was taken to be told by her and another member of staff that the money would be reimbursed.
This was not the case and to be honest we found the hotel manager to be quite unhelpful and incompetent with resolving this matter- the police we're called and a statement was taken by them.
All in all, the experience was a very bad one and handled in a very un professional manner.
Duane Street hotel need to realise that a member of staff is ROBBING cash from residents rooms. I'd advise people to look to other hotels for their stay in New York.",positive,en

"First of all the location of this hotel is excellent. Its situated in Vermont a quiet neighbourhood, and 15 - 20 minutes to Universal Studios, Paramount Studios and the airport. We did venture outside a few times and found it to be safe and had no issues, there is a small convenience store opposite which was handy for beers and snackss, but to other than that you need a car to get to places.
Its located near to a large hospital , so there were sirens going past all the time, so try to avoid the rooms located over the main road and side road.
We had issue with ants in the room, we left our left over takeaway in the bin and woke to find ants having a field day, so we left the bin outside the room, which was left by the cleaners for 2 days. So any food left over was thrown outside in the communal bins. Also one day we parked our car close to a tree in the car park and found ants inside the car.
The wireless was free , but they charge $20 per day to park the car in their secure car park, which should be included for guests.
The single queen room itself is ok in size, it has a fridge, microwave, and the usual rest. It doesnt deserve the 4 star rating or the glamourous Hollywood Hotel name, but it did the job for us. The lifts also take forever to take you anywhere so take a book!

I then got the short rib grilled cheese. IT was really really good. The meat was tender and flavorful. Secondly, the arugula was a nice touch in the grill cheese. I would definitely order it again. My friends got the shrimp jambalaya. It was a tad on the dry side, but they whipped up some extra sauce. Flavor was good. Not too spicy. I would order that again too. We got the butter cake to share.

قصة رائعة أفسدتها المبالغة الكوميدية إذا تعاملت مع الفيلم على أساس القصة فستجد نفسك أمام قصة قوية وغنية وثرية ومفيدة للغاية فهى تتناول قصة حياة فتاة مجتهدة في الحفظ في دراستها وتحصل على المركز الأول في الثانوية العامة وتحفظ المقرر من الكتاب وحتى رقم الإيداع ولكن لأن الممثلة ياسمين عبد العزيز ترغب في حصر نفسها في الأدوار الكوميدية لسبب أو لأخر، فقد قامت بأداء الشخصية بشكل كوميدي مبالغ فيه يبدو مقحما على الفيلم بشكل يفسد روعة القصة القصة لا كوميديا فيها بالقدر الذي ترغب فيه ياسمين ولذا فكانت تبالغ بشكل كبير في محاولة إضحاك المشاهدين مما أفسد الطبخة في رأيي أتوقع كان الفيلم ليصبح أقوى بكثير لو تم تقديمه كفيلم جاد قد لا يخلو من الكوميديا ولكن في حدود بحيث لا تفسد القصة الهادفة والتي تتناول قصة فتاة تتعرض للوقوع في براثن الثلاث تيارات الرئيسية في مصر فأول شاب هو الطالب الفاشل والثري الذي يحاول الإستفادة منها لكي ينجح في دراسته ثم يتركها ليرتبط بفتاة أخرى والشاب الثاني هو السياسي عضو حركة خنقتونا في إشارة لحركة كفاية وهو شاب يساري يتحدث عن الفقراء والعمال ولكن عندما يقود سيارته الفارهة ويمر من أمامه رجل بسيط يقوم بسبه لأنه لا يرغب في إنتظار مروره على قدميه أمام سيارته ويهدف للإيقاع بالفتاة في براثنه كنوع من أنواع إصطياد الفتيات من قبل الشباب ويظهر على حقيقته عندما يتخلى عنها عند إلقاء القبض عليها بسبب مشاركتها في المظاهرات أما الثالث فهو داعية يظهر في برامج التلفاز ويتحدث عن سماحة الإسلام ويدعو للعودة لله والطريق القويم ولكن عندما يتأخر صاحب المحطة التي يعمل فيها عن دفع أجره يهدد بالرحيل وعدم الظهور في البرنامج وهو يحاول إستغلال نفس الفتاة ولكن هذه المرة لتقديم برنامج دعوي نسائي للتعامل مع مشاكل النساء ويظهر على حقيقته عندما يقوم بالصياح في وجه الأطفال عند تصوير إعلان عن نوع حليب الفيلم ليس سيئا أبدا ولكني شخصيا لم أجد بداخلي الحماس لمشاهدته مرة أخرى وأشعر بتحسر على عدم تقديم القصة القوية بشكل يليق بها حتى وإن لم يكن شكل الفيلم ضعيفا إلا أنه في رأيي لم يرتقي لمستوى القصة.,negative,ar

"Hey Rudy L. Take you snobby sushi eating attitude somewhere else. So what it used to be a l&l and has no bar doesn't mean the food isn't good. FYI you need to reread your review before you actually save it. \n\nI've been to literally 20-30 sushi places around the valley some gross and some awesome and this place is close to awesome. Yes it's family owned and the daughter with a huge bun on top of her head is the waitress and the son and father make the sushi. But most of the time mom and pop shops are the best but in this case the son is the owner. \n\nMy favorite things to order are Tuna Karai, Arizona roll and surf and turf. the tuna Karai is a tuna salad with octopus and it's spicy but sooooo damn good. Sometimes I'll order 2 orders with some rice and make that as my meal. \n\nI've had a lot of other rolls to with friends and they are great. The big thing for me is presentation and the sushi looks great. Doesn't look sloppy, no big and small pieces, rice is tight and intact. The fish taste and smells very fresh. \n\nThey also have Korean tea. Which is basically barley tea it's very good, ask for it cold. \n\nAnytime I'm in the area I try to stop by and get my tuna Karai fix. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because they don't serve alcohol yet. \n\nKeyword is \""yet\"" I talk to the owner Steve a lot when I'm there and he's already in the process of getting his liquor license which should be approved by may.

I think this is just the place you go for a date or to drink alcohol and to see and be seen. If that's your priority, then you'll probably be plenty satisfied. Then again, that would make you a narcissistic bleach-blonde sock-puppet incapable of good taste. \n\nI certainly got the feeling from the waitstaff that I was being ranked, and when the bill was not adding up quickly enough, their attention drifted away from me. I kinda hate that, especially since I worked in restaurants, and I know that tips are a self-fulfilling prophecy most of the time. \n\nAnyway, not hitting them too hard, because everyone just managed to do what they had to within a slim margin of error. No real complaints. \n\nEnjoy those margaritas, sock-puppets!",negative,en

"This was your average hotel room (I hear from my friends that this is not always the case in NYC). It was clean and in a good location. The staff was very nice. The room had a refrigerator and a microwave which was a nice touch. The elevators were a little slow, but they usually are in big cities. It was noisy outside a couple of nights, but the hotel can't help that the trash was being collected at 2 in the morning. The subway was right around the corner, and you can walk pretty much anywhere (near times square, the empire state building, and madison square garden).

"Home Room deals with a Columbine-like high-school shooting but rather than hashing over the occurrence itself the film portrays the aftermath and what happened to the survivors, their trauma, guilt and denial.*Spoilers* The shooting itself is treated as a foregone conclusion, with no action footage other than the reaction of an almost teenage SWAT commando after shooting the high school killer. The film has three protagonists; the detective investigating the crime of which no guilty parties are left to convict and two teenage girls surviving the incident, played by a very young Erika Christensen and Busy Philipps.The two girls having nothing in common besides the shooting are put together because of it and the drama ensues.Erika Christensen, though only 24 has been around the block so much that film viewers are pretty much acquainted with her solid and reliable style of acting. Busy Philipps, three years older than Christensen and altogether unknown to me, blew me away with her overwhelming dramatic strength and screen presence. This girl was the part.It's a great movie and it connects to you with its intimate focus on the fragile yet growing relationship between the two traumatized girls. Gus van Sant's Elephant (2003) though good, seems almost superficial and paltry compared to Home Room when it comes to dramatic flair and acting. What I can see this film got very little screen time and exposure - so much more a loss for an equally traumatized America.Ten out of Ten",positive,en

"We stayed in this hotel five years ago and had a nice room, clean with acceptable bed and relatively well isolated windows facing the streets.
But this time!!Luckily we checked out and changed hotels right after the first night.
The room was very big, I mean the living room. The bedroom, where you end up spending most of your time was tiny, stinky and the bed was literally falling apart. Very bad mattress and sheets that felt like polyester plastic on your skin.
Cleanliness was questionable.
Everything was topped by the poor isolation in the windows that were facing to the back of the building where the aircon machine was making airplane engine- like noise and I didn't sleep a wink without having nightmares about airplanes.
I would rather stay in a well appointed small room with a proper bed and bathroom than in this noisy suite that is falling apart. For the same amount of money it is possible in mid-town so don't waste money on this 'over sized' nightmare.",negative,en

"The Lotus has been on Water St, in Henderson, since 1994. It is a great \""hole-in-the-wall\"" Chinese restaurant. We decided to stop in for an impromptu lunch with some friends.\n\nThe decor is a bit odd and the ceiling fans below the recessed lighting makes you feel like you are at a rave and need some glow sticks. The waitress was very friendly and quickly sat us. We went during lunch time and they were a bit busy and with only one person waiting tables it took a while to place our orders. We all ordered off the lunch special menu. They had lots of yummy options and at good prices. You get your choice of soups either egg drop or wonton soup, We all chose the wonton soup and it was excellent, (I'd go back just for the soup) I ordered the moo goo gai pan which came with lots of fresh veggies. You get a large portion and it also came with fried rice and an egg roll. My husband ordered mongolian beef which he said was also tasty, but not very spicy like he had expected it to be. If you like spicy mongolian beef, ask them to spice it up! \n\nI would definitely go here again. They have good food and great prices. I can't wait to go back again! In the end, the five of us ate for under $40. That is a very rare thing now a days.",neutral,en

Served with an overly dusty coating and no sauce.\n\n- Hot and Sour Soup: All hot, no sour, with an unwelcome sweetness. They took it off the bill, though.\n\n- Kung Pao Chicken: Bland in taste and texture, with large, flat medallions of tough chicken and super-sweet cashews overpowering any hope of a savory note.\n\n- Braised Kobe Short Ribs: Stew meat served on a gelatinous bed of noodles oozing some kind of thin brown liquid. Tasteless and unappetizing for everyone at the table.\n\nWe were far too disappointed by this point to try dessert. Plus we were both still hungry, so we left and got chili-cheese fries at Snacks on the casino floor. Now THOSE were really good!",negative,en

"My ice cream at Atomic #7 was unique to say the least.

The product was amazing and that's what I was hoping for. \n\nBecause I ordered coconut milk, I didn't feel full of mucus and not over-sweetened. The ice cream tasted fresher than I'm used to, mainly because it was made just for me.\n\nThe employees helped us figure out what we wanted to order, and once you grasp the concept of creating ice cream in 7 steps, it goes pretty easy.\n\nI loved the smiles of all the employees and their equipment made me jealous I don't have a commercial-grade Mix Master with the liquid nitrogen feed to create the frozen treat.\n\nI was pleased to see a full store when I walked in, and I hope they find ways to move the line more quickly.

"The often-reliable Leonard Maltin says this is a ""delightful romance"" and that Sanders is ""superb."" Maltin must have confused this movie with something else. Sanders is snide and droll and superb, as usual,  you can imagine his delivery of the line regarding adultery, ""Sometimes the chains of matrimony are so heavy they have to be carried by three,"" but dull, wooden and dated describe this movie more accurately. The storyline itself, an autobiography with Sanders as a suave jewel thief, Francois Eugene Vidocq, who becomes chief of police but can hardly resist the lure of fine jewels, is entertaining enough, but it has the same kind of hollow historical Hollywood treatment that marred such period epics as *Marie Antoinette*, and certainly the deplorable *Forever Amber* (which screams for a classy remake). Though, in his defense, Sanders tries mightily to add some depth to his character, it is all for naught. I am an unabashed Douglas Sirk fan, but this is 1946, and it is one of Sirk's earliest American efforts, lacking many of the signature touches that would define his florid, breast-heaving potboilers. Sirk is just getting his feet wet here, and made a number of unmemorable films over the next ten years until he struck gold with *Magnificent Obsession*, and hit his stride, bombarding us with such estrogen-fests as *All That Heaven Allows*, *Written on the Wind*, and *Imitation of Life*. But *Scandal In Paris* is hardly his best work  a relatively low-budget affair with cheesy sets and ineffective costuming.",negative,en

"We were upgraded to the Teddy Roosevelt suite from a regular room due to problems with our cards not working in the door of our room. We were so excited at the spaciousness of the room and the staff could NOT be any nicer -- very accommodating and pleasant, especially the young man at the front desk who assisted us throughout our stay. However, I MUST tell you, the suite is definitely haunted. My husband, a diehard macho non-believer in the paranormal is now a believer. What happened in that room is still unbelievable, but yet so real. From 1-3 a.m. things happened that cannot be explained by man. Evidently, others were experiencing some strange things, because when we looked out over the courtyard, half of the lights of the other rooms were brightly lit! And this was at 2:30 in the morning. Wow. Anyway, here's a heads up to anyone thinking of staying in that suite!",positive,en

It is far enough from the strip so that you aren't stuck in that nasty traffic.\n\nThe front desk and valet service is always nice. Their complimentary drinks (while playing) are always strong and their food isn't too bad. The pool area is nice although they can use a little more shade options out there. \n\nThis place can feel a little run down from time-to-time in their regular rooms and they definitely need some upgrades. Outside of that, it is not too bad of a place to visit every now and then.",negative,en

自己肯定感って、持って生まれた性格もあるだろうけど、育てられ方で大きく変わるものなんですね。 大人になって、いろいろ考えることができ、話をちゃんと聞いてくれるパートナーに巡り会えて良かったと思いました。 「自分嫌いあるある」は、自己肯定感の低い、高い関係なく誰しも当てはまる部分はありそうです。 ただそれを悩み落ち込んでしまうのが、自己肯定感の低い人ということなのでしょうか。 「自分だけでも自分の味方でいてあげて」という、ジャズボーカルの先生の言葉がじんわりきました。,neutral,ja

"The service at the front desk (Maria) was awesome! We were welcomed with smiles galore and all staff were fantastic. We were upgraded for some reason and the room was great. It was a suite. The large plasma tv was on a huge hinge that could face towards the bed or towards the couch. The bathroom was very elegant and smart looking although it would have been good to have more bench space for toiletries. The hallways looked very romantic with their red hues and lights. One thing I didn't like was the lift. Although it worked, it was too slow for me so I just got used to six flights of stairs and used this as daily exercise! Breakfast was basic but was sufficient. Also, the noise of the garbage trucks in the morning is unbelievable. But on the sixth floor towards the back, there is no other street noise that bothered me. Position near Union Square is great.

"We stayed at the Alexander Inn for my daughters' law school graduation. The location was perfect since the ceremony was held at the Kimmel Center just two blocks away. There were many places to choose from as far as food all around the area (including Jose Garces Trading Company). The Continental Breakfast was the typical coffee, fruit, cereal and bagels but it was plentiful and convenient. The rooms were on the small side but clean and the mattresses comfortable. In fact, the rooms reminded me a lot of European hotels where they are functional and comfortable for someone who does not plan to stay in them much and would rather tour the area! What made this boutique hotel special was its location but also its staff. They were spot on with recommendations for places to eat, how to get there and what to do in the area. They called cabs at a moments notice, always had smiles and were most helpful in every way. If I needed to stay in the area again, I would call them first for a reservation.",positive,en

"This is just plain bad. Sometimes remakes, even if they stray from the original, are good on their own. They can bring another viewpoint and achieve a certain interpretation that makes them unique and enjoyable. This was as poorly thought out and carried out as can be. This wasn't any good even standing on it's own. Viggo Mortenson is a top-notch actor, but some of his selections of roles and projects leaves something to be desired. The original ""Vanishing Point"" was such a thrilling, psychological adventure; this is not an adventure at all, and is not enjoyable or entertaining whatsoever. This was made from a by-the-numbers approach to film-making, stuffing in plot points that someone in Hollywood believes will please what they see as today's film-going audience. Basically, they see us as a bunch of idiots. It's insulting that someone will put this out as a feature film, and even attempt to remake a cult classic this sloppily. The manipulative plot devices, the ""make-it-obvious-so-they-don't-miss-the-point"" aspects, ridiculous dialogue, stereotyped characters, amateurish direction...This is plain bad....",negative,en

"I used to eat at this building years ago. I think it was called Casa Rosa's at the time, but when I moved I wasn't able to visit again until after the business had shut down. For the first time in years, I saw this place open, so I excitedly pulled into one of the street side parking spaces and walked in. \n\nThe general idea of the place is the same. There is a tv, but the giant screen projection tv is gone for anybody that remembers it. You must walk in and go immediately left to see the counter where you order. All of the furniture is new and the interior has been completely remodeled from the looks of it. The employees were extremely helpful and polite, and I believe it was the owner that introduced himself to me. I ordered the Cubano, which alone is not nearly enough for a meal even though it was delicious. It was served with an excellent avocado sauce (didn't seem quite like guac). \n\nThey have a full selection of beverages imported from Mexico and therefore not including high fructose corn syrup. Order one of these with a two empanada lunch combo. Their prep time was very fast making this a good place for a lunch break or date. It also looks like they're applying for their beer license (exciting). \n\nIf you haven't been here since the building reopened in July 2013, it's definitely worth stopping by if you're in downtown Mesa around lunchtime.",neutral,en

"My biggest quandary with this place is whether I'm going to be going back there by myself in October when I'm in Vegas again, or if I have to drag my cousins along.... \n\nOh Hash House, you go-go with the yummy food! My girl friend loves this place so much the nut bought everyone t-shirts to wear in Northern Virginia. She said she couldn't stand to be the only person wearing their T-shirt. And yes, we were so jealous when she went back to Vegas without us for a conference and took pictures to send our way. (There were some names that were used in text exchanges, but thats neither here nor there.) \n\nWe were just there in June. And nostalgically I recall that someone ordered their pancakes...stupid enormous, I had french toast and a side of biscuits and gravy. Did I say side? More like a HUGE portion for one. Hubby had corned beef hash and says it was too good to not continue eating. (I know he over did it because he could barely eat ONE In and Out Burger 4 hours later!) \n\nWe went really early in the morning for breakfast and they were empty. Still, we liked going through the maze that is the Quad to go up the escalator to the yumminess that \nawaited us. Given that there are so many awesome places to eat, we didn't eat there again, but its on our list of places to hit up without a DOUBT!

"I selected this flight as a connecting flight from HK to Singapore 4 months ago. First, they wouldn't let me book a seat until 48 hours before the flight and kept telling to me call back. After 6 times of calling this airline and 4 months later, they said they are fully booked and just assigned a crap seat to us in different parts of the plane. service during the flight was appalling especially since it was during the holidays. Crew was rude to female customers and ignored servicing them. I even saw a crew member push a lady's chair and kept yelling at her about her chair and then condescendingly responded to her inquiry about meal options.

"Stayed at the Doubletree for 3 nights from 30th December to 2nd January.
Our stay at the Doubletree was a welcome addition to our holiday. We'd previously been staying at the Westin Times Square (see separate review) for the previous 9 nights and Vegas for 10 nights before that (see separate Luxor review). Originally we’d planned to fly home to celebrate New Year with our friends but when we heard it was the centennial anniversary of the ball drop we tagged on these three extra days at the Doubletree Guest Suites.
Checked in easily at around 12.30pm and very glad our suite was ready for us on arrival, so we didn't have to stow our gear as we had planned a afternoon out to Brooklyn. Liked the free cookies although I'm glad you only get one on the first day as it was a real sugar high!
The 30th floor suite itself was great; although at the end of the corridor, so you had to crane your neck to see Times Square (actually just Duffy Square). After the Westin it was really nice to get the extra space and extra facilities, such as the fridge and a microwave. This meant we could easily stock up on a few chilled items for New Year. The fixtures and fittings look older and slightly more tired (E.g. one of our phones wouldn't pick up, the other wouldn’t dial out) but it had everything we needed. Another thing we were really glad of was the security on the front door that was making sure no one got in without a room key all day long. The first night we ordered room service and it was delivered within 30 minutes. The price wasn't unreasonable. It was fairly average but it was still warm and there was plenty of it. Didn’t eat at the hotel lounge but the 'compact' bar was fully stocked and had a happy hour to tempt in punters.
In contrast to a previous poster we found the Refreshment prices pretty acceptable for a central New York hotel. Only problem was the safe deposit box. It wasn't quite big enough for my laptop so we had to check that in at the front desk, this was a slight problem as there is no distinct line for check-in/out and other hotel functions. So a line of people were waiting in the check-in line intermingled with people wanting safe deposit, valet parking tickets, etc. That took 25 minutes as receptionists seemed to take an age to process each check-in (heard someone mention a ""systems problem"").
We got an information letter from the hotel about the New Year festivities. It appeared we could get out onto the square up to 10pm at night to see the ball drop, but we'd already booked to spend the night at the Olive Garden across the road (which I would heartily recommend – $165 pp but not overbooked, well stocked open bar, nice buffet, DJ/Disco, out for the ball drop at 11.45pm then back in until 1am). The letter warned against excessive alcohol and that excessive noise would be dealt with by security, which we were very glad about. I wish the letter had also mentioned that getting back to the hotel even by 4pm could be only facilitated by approaching from 6th or 8th Ave down 47th street. We’d got off the subway around 3.50pm at 7th / 42nd Street (Times Square) and got stuck in the crowds/NYPD cordons that were already jamming the pavements. Despite being so close and showing our room key ot took about 40 minutes to free ourselves to get out the square to get to 47th Street. I'm glad for the revellers (we saw some camped out at 11am) that it was a mild New Years Eve, as the wind-chill earlier in the week had been 9 deg F / -14 deg C.
I’d certainly stay in the Doubletree Guest Suites again if I was staying around Times Square to get the extra floor space/amenities and a location right on the Square.

"Although Hanny's is very lovely inside if you like modern and sleek, I think the service definitely leaves something to be desired. It started with our drink orders... The waiter essentially refused to serve me three of my drink choices, saying they would be \""too strong\"" for me. Maybe they didn't feel like making them that night? I finally was allowed to order a champagne cocktail. My colleague ordered the Moscow Mule, and they held her credit card in exchange for he copper cup... Which was fine until we had to track it down at the end of the night and the waiter totally forgot he even had it.\n\nThe food choices were limited, so I went with the small snack plate with some meats and cheeses. A few people at the table had the pork scallopini and didn't particularly like it, saying the sauce was awful. The bruschetta was also laced with black and green olives which was unexpected.\n\nOverall, service was slow and disinterested, and the food was nothing to write home about.

"We chose this resort for our last night in Phoenix, (and because it was a Marriott) to end our vacation on a fabulous note (so we thought). We checked into our room, which was beautiful and had a great bathroom and comfortable beds. The TV would not decrease past 19 on the volume level, and I called the front desk to ask for help. The question I was asked was ""did you try the remote?"". Wow. About 30 minutes later, a maintenance man appeared and was mystified because he couldn't decrease the volume either, so he called in assistance. It could not be repaired, so we were moved to another room--this was about 1 1/2 hours after we had checked in (for only one night). The next room was exactly the same, and the TV worked. I went into the restroom to use splash water on my face and almost overflowed the sink because the stopper was broken and plugged the sink. I had to reach in to dig the stopper out, and didn't bother asking for it to be fixed because our time had already been wasted some. There are no vending machines on the property, which was an issue for us because my husband is diabetic and sometimes needs a quick soda if his sugar levels drop suddenly. **The last problem we did not discover until we were already home--when checking in we were asked for a card for any incidental expenses, which we are accustomed to, and my husband gave his debit card--now, normally we would use a credit card, but staying only 1 night we knew we would have no additional expenses. Checking our bank statement, a $210 charge was debited at the exact same time we checked into this establishment. Our room rate was only $161 plus taxes (government rate)! I called the hotel Saturday, and they said they could offer no help, it would have to wait until Monday and a separate billing department would be able to assist me. I did call them Monday, and was told by a representative that it was a ""hold"" placed on the funds (which renders them completely frozen until Marriott calls the bank to have them released). That's all fine and good, but we were not told that any amount would be frozen by the check-in girl, and we travel frequently and are used to giving a card for incidentals, which we normally never accrue. Our 1st 2 nights in Scotsdale we stayed at a lower star Marriott and this one could use some tips to earn its higher star rating. As stated by others, the housekeeping staff did not acknowledge us at all when we walked by, and we always make a point to speak to housekeeping in the hotels we use. We would never consider staying here again, much to our disappointment. It didn't ruin our entire vacation, but what a hassle!",negative,en

"安過ぎて不安になる
中国から郵便で送られては時間がかかり過ぎるので、KKマーケットの方に注文。ゆうパックで４日後に郵便受けに入っていました。 あまりに安いので不安でしたが、自動車部品の配線の仕方を解説するサイトで同銘柄の製品を使ってましたので注文。 怖いのは『発熱』です。まさかとは思いますが、温度補償や過電流対策の付いたDC-DCコンバーター用のLSIじゃなく、３端子レギュレータのような降圧分のエネルギーを熱で放散させるような仕組みじゃなかろうな？というのが懸念です。もしそうなら、金属製の箱に入ってないと危険です。各種保護回路の入った専用LSIを使用しているのなら『変換効率』はわかるはずなので明記してほしいです。電子部品的には85%程度のものが多いです。保護回路入りのLSIを使っても、放熱板は必須なので発熱は起こります。 バラして調べるのは面倒なので、とりあえずワゴンRに取り付けACCからの配線でGorillaナビの電源にします。配置がうまく行けばドラレコも。２台で最大2.2A（5V)の計算です。 使ってみて発熱が酷いようなら後日報告します。ま、今のような真冬ではテストになりませんが・・。 ちなみに、バイクでナビを使う時用には別途、防水対策をしてある商品を使っていますが、全配線やコネクタ類も付いているとはいえ10倍ぐらいの価格はします。自動車用だとエーモンの2880あたりが800円（１ポート）ですね。念のため購入してあります。 この『念のため』というのは発熱の不安ではなく、USB配線の延長部分の長さの問題で２ポート装備品が使いづらい可能性があるからです。 直流での配線は長いと電圧降下を起こしますから、12vの配線を長くして使用機器の近くまで持っていき、5vのUSB配線は短くすべきなんですね。だから２ポート品で左右に分かれると一方が使えなくなるかもしれません。只の電源配線ならともかく、USBは元々通信用ですから電源以外の通信線が含まれ、線材が細くなっていて余計に電圧降下しやすいですからね。実際に電源延長用にUSB延長線を買おうとすると、電圧降下の問題で長いものほど電源の延長配線に向かないことを思いしります。 そのくせ、ナビやドラレコは5v仕様になって来てるんだよね・・・。",neutral,ja

"I can't believe that I have been driving right past this place for over a year and I never tried it. I visited yesterday for lunch on a whim and was seriously impressed. The atmosphere is pretty dive-y, but the food is delicious! They also have a really awesome selection of beer on tap. Be warned, the Blue Dust slogan is \""no crap on tap\"" and they aren't kidding. Don't expect to find any Budweiser, Miller, Coors, or Yuengling on tap here. They did have Guinness on tap, and you can take that for what it is. Draft prices are pretty reasonable (around $6), especially compared to other places on the Waterfront with decent beer (Burgatory, Rock Bottom). \n\nI started with one of the soups of the day, curry crab bisque, and was blown away. It was spicy and flavorful with some decent crab. I ordered a bowl and the portion was really generous--bigger than the bowls in my own kitchen. My boyfriend got the grilled chicken appetizer with barbeque sauce and was impressed with the quality of the chicken and sauce.\n\nFor my lunch I got the 3 cheese sandwich, which comes with fresh basil and tomato. I asked if they could add onion and they did so for free. It was very good, but not great. I guess it's hard to blow people away with a cheese sandwich, so no worries. My boyfriend got the pulled pork sandwich (\""porkzila\"") and loved it. He said he intends to go back and order the same thing. A friend was also impressed with his hot italian sandwich, which looked to have a generous portion of meat and cheese. Sandwiches come with either chips and salsa or cole slaw (the vinegar kind, not the mayo kind). The salsa is a basic pico, but I really liked it. I didn't try the cole slaw. \n\nI liked this place a lot and will definitely go back to try some of their other options. Reasonably priced beer on tap is enough of a draw by itself.",neutral,en

"I found this film completely and utterly incomprehensible. I knew some of he facts about Caravagggio, but here they were twisted and puzzling. The images were weirdly interesting but I was looking more for a biographical and/or critical accounting of Caravaggio's life and works, not an LSD type drug trip. The dialogue was very confusing and jumping back and forth in time via the use of trains, calculators, typewriters and cigarettes was extremely distracting.

"As a spiritualist and non Christian. I thought i really was going to be holding onto my faith, but what a load of i seers. I thought the film would have great arguments, but only got one sided views from Atheists and Jews??? And who are all these street people he's interviewing who don't know the back of their arm from their head. Where are the proper theologians and priests and stuff he could have got arguments from. Not retired nuts who wrote books and finished their studies in 1970. Personally this DVD was a waste of time and not worth my time to check if the facts are right or wrong or if i should or should not believe because an anti-Christ told me so. Please to think he came up with the conclusion of not finding God because his own ego and demons got the better of him. No im not going to say the movie was stunning to help atheists reading this feel better about themselves.

Book the cool meals out from Singapore was definitely a good choice, and the ability to view the standard menu prior also does help. Using book the cook service, I selected Nasi Biriyani and Nasi Lemak and the former smelled really fragrance and tasted really good.

"I stayed at the Wardman Park Marriott from Wednesday 6/13 to Sunday 6/17.
Check-in: A - I checked in at 11am and received our room right away. Staff was polite and helpful.
Room: A - I was in the Wardman Tower room 1344. It was a standard room with a king sized bed. The bathroom was large and clean. As was the room. There was plenty of closet space in the walk-in closet. I was on the first floor with a view of the pool. Although I thought it may be noisy being directly next to the pool, I never heard a sound when the window was closed.
Housekeeping: A+ - Housekeeping was great. They came each afternoon and cleaned the room very well. They left extra towels and toiletries each day. The service was excellent.
Room Service: A- - Room service was prompt and the food was hot. The only complaint I had was they served it on a tray and not on a rolling table. Otherwise it was good.
Overall I would give the hotel an A. It was close to the Metro stop and the Wardman tower had historic charm. I would chose to stay here again!",positive,en

"I stayed at Washington Square Hotel for 5 nights at the beginning of January, and I agree with most of the other reviews: the location is its main attraction, and I really recommend it if you want to be in a less touristic but much more interesting area as the Village, that's lively, beautiful and with a wonderful choice of restaurants, bars and music venues at walking distance. Also, the hotel it's close to the subway, so you can reach any part of NY very easily.
But the hotel itself costs a bit too much for what it offers. The decor and atmosphere are nice, and the staff is helpful, but go for the deluxe rooms, as I understand that they are bigger than the one we've been given, that was small even for NY standards, with an extremely tiny cupboard (no way to unpack your luggage), not very comfortable bed and not terribly clean. Also, the breakfast is ""continental"", but there's no buffet so you don't have any choice and if you are a big eater or want to skip lunch (as I do), you'll end eating breakfast somewhere else.
In general, the feeling is that they don't try very hard because they know that the location is unbeatable and (as far as I know) there is no alternative of the same level in the area. But you don't go to New York to spend your time in your hotel room, so the location is still the most important issue. And walking in Washington Square on a sunny morning or around Bleecker St. at night makes up easily for a smallish room...",negative,en

"We were in Memphis for a bridge tournament and wanted someplace centrally located and this was our choice.
We checked the reviews before booking and were quite satisfied with our stay. Those reviewers who called it a dump are dead wrong and are probably the kind of people who are who are never satisfied, no matter what. Those reviewers who thought it the next best thing to sliced bread probably have not travelled much.
The hotel is centrally located, relatively newly furnished, clean and comfortable. The staff were friendly and helpful.
We were, however, surprised that for a ""suite"" type hotel, there were no dishes, wine glasses, cutlery or anything to facilitate a light en suite lunch or even a take out meal.
The complimentary breakfasts were good and plentiful (toast, bagels, scrambled eggs, sausage, biscuits, waffles, oatmeal, cereals, fresh fruit, juice and coffee).
The parking was just kitty corner at the parking lot in front of the Sleep Inn, next door. You can drive there yourself or get a valet to do it for you. The cost is the same.
Our car was there for four days & nights and we didn't fear for it. Nor did we ever feel the slightest bit uneasy in downtown Memphis. The police presence is palpable and any thug would be taking his/her life in her hands to try to accost a visitor.
Beale Street was a few block walk away for pretty good food at almost any place on the street. Ditto for Huey's for superb hamburgers and excellent beer.

"Whereas my rating would have been much higher should I have reviewed this after my first visit; however with repeat visits my experience has been less than stellar.\n\nI will start by saying the specialty coffee drinks are excellent, only if created by the main Barista - Steve. He is highly skilled in his craft, only to be pulled down by the sub par help who backs him up. Every experience with employees other than Steve has been dismal, and this review serves as a wake-up call to the management staff to better train their employees on service and skill.\n\nOf the many negative points I can make about the staff, my last experience left me questioning if I should ever return. While not in the mood for a specialty drink, I decided to order the French Press coffee which is highlighted as a menu item. After I purchased my coffee, I found a mug of drip coffee sitting on the bar. Assuming it was for someone else, I continued to wait for my French Press. Several minutes went by, and I inquired as to where my drink was, to which I was simply pointed to the cup sitting on the bar. I stated what was there was not French Press coffee, and in response I was told that their drip coffee IS French Press. Color me confused, but what was sitting on the bar was not what I had ordered, nor what I had paid a premium for.\n\nUnfortunately, banter back and forth with the staff led me nowhere but sitting at a table with my stale drip coffee, now only luke warm from sitting too long. Only able to tolerate a few sips, I left the mostly full cup of stale diner coffee questioning if I would ever return.\n\nSince then, there have been several occasions where I contemplated going back; however I have yet to convince myself of the benefit. \n\nUnfortunately this hidden gem of a coffee house has been tarnished by the service and lack of experience. Hopefully with time the talent will improve and better decisions will be made as to how to keep customers coming back.",negative,en

"Que dire de ce film… Déjà qu’il s’inspire de beaucoup de choses. Entre autre, les films de zombies de Romero, les gunfights de plein de films, notamment ceux de Kitano, les chorégraphies de Matrix, les giclées de tripailles de Bad Taste, etc… Ensuite, qu’en tant que film fauché, il gagne fortement en sympathie. Enfin, que la virtuosité du montage ne peut pas occulter complètement un récit visiblement écrit par un schizophrène en pleine crise. Versus est assez bien foutu. Avec davantage de moyens et d’inspiration Ryuhei Kitamura pourrait facilement faire parler de lui. Tout comme Bad taste en son temps, ce film de potes se détache du lot par son humour et son intensité, décisifs pour combler le vide d’un scénario qui n’est que prétexte à déballer tout ce qu’un jeune cinéaste a vu et adoré dans ses jeunes années chez ses illustres confrères.

L’histoire se passe dans un pénitencier, une série de suicides se produisent, à l’endroit même où un meurtre a eu lieu il y a fort longtemps, tous ces éléments se rejoignent comme par magie, c’est alors qu’un flic persévère à vouloir élucider le mystère, face à un gardien hostile (on sent déjà les clichés à plein nez). Fier d’avoir une mise en scène qui carbure (on ne sait pas à quoi), ce qui est sûr, c’est que William Butler voulait un thriller horrifique qui bouge et c’est le cas. Simplement, on a tendance à trouver le temps long rapidement, quand on constate que tous les personnages ou presque tournent en rond. Bien que le casting soit plutôt sympathique (Tom Sizemore, Danny Trejo & Ja Rule), on reste très déçu du dénouement de ce pseudo film horrifique.",negative,fr

"It's a great hotel...so why shouldn't it have a good buffet?\n\nI was sorely disappointed. This buffet lacked selections. They tried to be different and unique, but they fail miserably. Every dish at the Aria Buffet tried to be a little bit different than your traditional Las Vegas buffet. So it sets up the expectation for more refined flavors and quality. Well, \n\nThe Indian station is interesting, but the flavors were unauthentic. The Chinese station was terrible...I'd rather eat at Panda Express! The Sushi station...ummm, I almost missed the 4 types of very ordinary and cheap rolls (and there was so much rice in the sushi that you could hardly tell it was sushi!). The \""sage\"" rotisserie chicken had no flavor. The smoked pork chop was humongous...but had very little smoke flavor.\n\nThe crab legs were good, but the melted butter had no flavor. The prime rib was good (and rare!), but the whipped horseradish was terrible...there were clumps of cream...and I had to use my fork to break up the cream and mix with the pure horseradish. Really???\n\nThe desserts really piqued my interest, and since I didn't gorge on the savory items like I usually do at buffets...I had plenty of room for dessert! So here's my rundown:\n\n-Gelato was great, but such a limited selection.\n-Creme Brulee was delicious!\n-Cheesecake was not rich enough nor was the crust hearty enough.\n-Sugar-free Chocolate Cake was decent...but couldn't they use some Splenda?\n-Cookies were so-so...I've had better at cheaper buffets. \n\nThe service was standard buffet service...not impressive. For a hotel like Aria, I certainly expected this to be a much better experience. I can easily find a better meal in Vegas for $27.99!",negative,en

"We have just returned from a lovely trip to the Carlyle. It's a beautiful hotel with stunning deco and interiors. The room was comfortable. We had fantastic views over Manhattan and Central Park from our 23rd floor room.
Breakfast was good but the service was a little slow and inattentive. Bemelman's bar was a great place to enjoy an evening listening to live jazz music. This was the best part of our stay at the hotel.
The hotel had misplaced our booking of a car to pick us up from JFK, but they offered us a complimentary car on our return to JFK as an apology.
Staff were always friendly and able. We had a very good time. We may return but may also try one of New York's other 5 star hotels. We have stayed at the Ritz and the Plaza previously and I would put it roughly on a par with those hotels, though the location is not as good in our opinion.",positive,en
"The bed was the best. Super comfortable and large. The room was extra large too with plenty of space to move around even with our 4 suitcases spread far and wide. The shower was lovely. No bathtub, but with a shower this nice, we never missed a tub. Had all the amenities we needed and they were nice quality as well. I almost never think there are adequate blankets on the bed but there were here. And the breakfast was much more than we hoped for by the description of 'continental breakfast'. There was an omelet station where you could choose from fresh ingredients and have it made to order, plus biscuits and gravy, waffles, tons of fresh fruit, yogurt, cottage cheese, and all the other cereals, muffins and pastries you would normally expect. The only downfalls were some cosmetic repairs that needed attention, both in the halls and our room, and the tv really needed updating. We had a remote held together by tape that only worked some of the time. Overall, we enjoyed our stay and would have a hard time finding anything even half as nice for the price.",positive,en

"I have only had the pho here and this place is good in comparison to the rest of the pho places around, but definitely not the best pho I've had because I moved here from LA. One of my complaints about this place is that it inconsistent. I've come here before and had great pho and then on other days I've come and the noodles were too soggy and I would get more of one meat than another in my soup. Also, I think they overcook their tendon so it's a little too mushy for my liking. The veggies that come on the side are often not fresh, with the jalapenos looking a little old and withered, and the waitresses are always a little off-putting when you ask them for extra sides. If you want some authentic pho this is a good place to try, but I just don't think the quality is all there.",negative,en

"Art Fair on the Square is an annual event that I look forward to every summer in Madison, although I often feel like a little kid in the glassware section of the department store where I can look but I can't touch (or afford).\n\nHonestly, this event is more a display of artwork than an opportunity for art enthusiasts to purchase pieces. The prices are way out of the range of a casual art collector... There are a few artists who make cute knickknacks (tea bag holders, micro bowls, etc.) that are a little more affordable, but still nothing that I would realistically drop $10-20 on.\n\nEven then, I love seeing the diversity of the artists and the mediums they choose to use to convey their message. I amused myself by trying to pick out the pieces that I thought would be chosen for the Epic campus. :P \n\nIt's also just nice to see all of Madison out and about wandering around the Capitol. That's something I always look forward to during all of these city-wide events!\n\nTip: The farmer's market still takes place on the Saturday of the art fair! The selection is sparse, and their location is different (most likely pushed off into a side street), but keep an eye out for the fresh fruit and veggie stands!! They will be there!",neutral,en

"Great market for the size of Champaign/Urbana. Great variety of local meat, veggies, fresh cut/live flowers, cheese's, hand crafts, and jewelry. I like the influx of the food trucks, but Fryer Tucks was first and I find myself falling back to wanting a egg, cheese, and sausage on a wheat english muffin with onions. They use eggs and sausage from the local vendors. I think Cracked might also use local eggs, but not sure. \nThere are your mainstay vendors, but every year there is some turn over with new farmers or artisans that help to make every year a little different.\nThe live music provided by good and not so good musicians also lends to the character of the market. It is also nice to peruse the various community groups whom are out there. Art mart, Lincoln Square Mall, Common Ground Co-op and downtown Urbana are all right there also.\nSeveral veggie vendors have seconds available to help save a few $ as the market is not as cheap as the grocery store. Garlic in particular seems $$ to me, but the varieties have been fun to explore and I hear tell its not as easy to grow and prep for market as onions.\nI will also be quite honest it's not just about the food and crafts. For me the market is very much part of my social life. I see so many people I know there every Saturday morning from co-workers, to neighbors, to random friends I have not seen in months. I've made friends with many of the vendors and look forward to talking to them about their grandkids, their hogs not liking the left over broccoli, growing conditions, recipes, and food policy. The community I have found on the corner of Illinois and Vine is lively, generally friendly, and safe.",neutral,en

When asked, they said that the plane was overbooked, and they couldn't wait for us. So they take off late and the same company doesn't care to wait 5 min. Instead they will run away early, because they sell the tickets twice. They made us wait in the airport for over 12 hours to wait for the next flight, and gave use $15 voucher to eat. $15 for the whole day? This was the biggest joke.

"Очень люблю сеть, но конкретно на Кузнецком мосту отвратительное отношение к посетителям, а также дезинформация относительно меню. Во-первых, очень долго ждали заказ, более 40 минут (!). Хотя по сути заказ в основном состоял и нескольких порций хинкали и хачапури. Также очень был неприятный момент в конце, когда принесли счет. Заказывали стакан компота и морса, в меню указан объем 200мл. без какого либо выбора (нет объема ни 300мл.,ни 400мл.). Как оказалось, нам пробили по два стакана напитков, сказав, что принесли стакан объемом 400мл., якобы нам принесли среднюю порцию. Т.е. мы заказав 2 стакана, заплатили за 4 (!) В итоге за компот отдали почти 1000, у которого красная цена 10 рублей за стакан. Для чего данный ход? Чтобы повысить маржинальность бизнеса за счет напитков или что? Резюмируя, сотрудники ресторана не очень расторопны на кухне, что исключает возможность устроить недолгий обед/ужин, также вам могут пробить какие-то несуществующие средние порции, которые вы якобы заказали, но при этом в счете указывать две стандартные порции.

"Denver to Gatwick. Wamos Air was used by Norwegian Air during my trip home to the UK in December. They contacted me by e mail informing me of this change. I was rather annoyed as I had flown Norwegian in the Summer as was very pleased with the service. I called Norwegian whose agent assured me it would be exactly the same service including my seat reservation and ordered vegetarian meal. The flight out from Denver was ok, despite my vegetarian meal being some inedible dried up pasta dish. Breakfast was a barely thawed hard bread mozzarella sandwich. There were no TV'S in the seats and one had to log on onto Wamos Air which I was not prepared to do as I only had Cellphone and did not want to use my batteries. In the return journey to Denver the flight was delayed by half an hour. In both directions I was placed in a middle seat not an aisle seat as booked. One lady was kind enough to swap with me. Fortunately on the way back the aisle seat next to me was vacant. By moving one seat over and informing the flight attendants I had done this, must have caused great confusion for them. I did not receive my vegetarian meal at all. I asked three times to various attendants which proved quite annoying to them regarding their passive aggressive facial expressions. Finally they told me they had run out of vegetarian hot lunches and brought me a cheese sandwich and a free beer, probably to appease me. I was not at all complaining at the time but their general attitude towards me was aloof and unfriendly. I went to the galley to ask for a cup of tea x interrupting three attendants happily chatting away in Spanish. I wondered why they could not have such cheery dispositions towards the passengers. One girl very much put out it appeared, gave me a cup of tea. The annoyance on her face was very apparent. I am shocked that a reputable good airline such as Norwegian would contract such a sub standard company to replace them. I paid my money and it was not that cheap for a service that made my journey uncomfortable and unfriendly. I have read other negative reviews of Wamos Air, so I am joining the throng of a large number number of very dissatisfied customers. Would not recommend Wamos to anyone.

"We have stay at the Univ. Club at least three times. Our most recent stay was a giant disappointment. Here are the lowlights:
1. Room was hot on entering (not uncommon). Turned on the AC and it sounded like a turned on an old engine. Clatter-clatter-clatter. I decided to see if I could look into the AC unit in the ceiling to hear what was causing the noise. The entire grate fell out of the ceiling....just missing me.
2. Called engineering to look at the above issue. They were able to diminish the sound level of the noise but not eliminate it. They were also not able to secure the gate in the ceiling covering the AC unit. The engineer suggested not to stand up in the grate which was in the inside doorway. This is a lawsuit waiting to happen. Past visits have revealed the deficiency of the Club's AC units....totally unacceptable for the price point of the U Club.
3. That night (at 3:40 am), a group returned from a night out and proceed to make a lot of noise and break some of their bottles and/or glasses. The Club needs to have a person in the lobby from 1 am on who will ""escort"" guests like these back to their room so they don't wake up other guests. This happens too often at the Club. The management needs to address the issue of drunks returning from a night out and disturbing other guests.
4. There were issues both on check in and check out that put a perfect circle around a miserable one-night stay at the Club. I won't bother you with the details because they probably are a function of new staff or very old systems and processes used at the Club.
My advice: stay at a place whose business is taking care of guests....from check-in to check-out.",negative,en
"Table was ready for 4 and a baby. I've been here for dinner and drinks but never been here for Sunday brunch so decided to give it a try. Actually the original intention was to find chocolate banana pancakes from the day before but noticed it was only a brunch for Sunday- not Saturday. Looking at the menu the first item that caught my eye was the chilaquiles for $10. I've had it at a different restaurant and had to try it for comparison purposes. It was quite unique in that the tortillas was cut up strips and fried. Some were covered in Oaxaca cheese and cotija cheese and red pepper coulis with some shredded green chili pulled pork hidden here and there and a sunny side up egg on top and some sauce. Not too bad. It could have had a little more sauce for the extra fried tortillas and a little bit more pulled pork. Others ordered the Bear Republic (chicken breast sandwich with avocado, lettuce, tomato, and bacon with a side of dill mustard like potato salad) for $12.50, and the Picadinho (diced NY strip steak, peas, rum sauce, Brazilian rice, 2 eggs made how you like and a side of seasonal fruit) for $16.

このイヤホン、何よりコスパに優れています。イヤーピースを紛失したり、あるいは破損しても直ちに買い換えられます。音質面においても高音はいくらか伸び悩むものの、迫力ある豊かな低音を響かせてくれます。遮音性は若干低め。ですが、何より特筆すべきは優れた装着感です。楕円形状ポートを採用したことによって、驚くべきほどに簡単かつ快適に装着できるほか、筐体が小さいため、枕に横になりつつ使用しても痛まないのです。外出時の使用にも耐えうる性能を備えていますが、寝フォンとしてもオススメ出来ます。これらのことから、同価格帯のイヤホンから頭一つ抜けた、実用レベルの性能を備えた高コスパイヤホンとしてオススメできます！,positive,ja
"The idea behind this movie was great. The story of a little girl facing abuse (both emotional and physical) and trying to deal with it and survive. What makes the movie fall apart is the terrible use of voice overs and the corny dialog. The actors have to point out the most obvious things over and over again. Also, there is very tedious, almost funny, overuse of metaphors in the voice overs. The high point is the acting of the little girl. Nice try, but this one's a stinker.",negative,en

The only down side is that I wish they would put more horseradish aioli on it. \nThe service was good. The waiter was sincere and polite.\n\nAnother up side is that it opens 24 hours so it is very convenient while the price isn't crazy. The decoration was very interesting too as there is a half wall made into an american map, and there is different things pinned on each state. For example, there is an alligator figure on the Florida state, and there is an astronaut figure on Texas.\nThey have a 4-7pm rib eye special. We probably will try it next time.",negative,en

This comes with an experienced staff which I think they lack.\n\nThe food was very good but I didn't walk out saying that was worth the money I just spent for the experience.

I asked for veggies instead of the potatoes and the only thing they would give me were sliced raw tomatoes. if I wanted anything else (I asked for broccoli) i was going to have to pay for a full side order. so I stuck with the tomato which was disappointing. it also came with 2 pieces of toast and one small jar of jelly. I hate that. And I didn't even get to choose what kind of jelly. they just had a jar of grape on the plate when they dropped it off. But the omelette hit the spot and started my day off right.\n\nThe place was really busy so the service was okay but it took way too long to get the bill.

Dusseldorf-Teheran-Bangkok return. Dusseldorf Check-in took less than 5 minutes including waiting in line. The flight between Dusseldorf and Teheran was on time flight attendants very polite and helpful. The food quality is medium as most airlines they seem to save money on food cost. The food quantity is still more than enough. The 3 hour transfer in Teheran is just long enough to stretch the legs and enjoy the voucher to buy some cake or sandwich in the coffee shop. Tax free shopping is limited so it is easier to resist the temptation to spend money - extra bonus is the free Wireless Internet in the terminal. Unfortunately the Iranian internet is censored but normal surfing and email works well. Teheran to Bangkok had about 3 hours delay. The majority of travellers were Iranians and they all stayed calm and nobody complained or started to ask question. The flight was a Boeing 747 and was fully packed. The food quality was the same as in the first leg not premium quality but the quantity is OK. Bangkok to Teheran. I was shocked when I arrived at the check-in at the airport. I have never seen such a long line waiting. Fortunately the passengers with final destination Dusseldorf had a separate check-in desk so had to wait less than 10 mins. The flight was good food as before staff friendly and helpful. A 3 hour stopover in Teheran.Teheran to Dusseldorf was on time food and crew at the same level as other flights. Mahan Air tickets are cheap I paid just 468 Euro for a roundtrip to Thailand and that is a bargain. As people say you get what you pay for and this is true for Mahan air. The planes are old there is almost no inflight entertainment but they try to do a lot with little money. The positive side is the friendly crew very calm and polite passengers a lot of food. When you are travelling on a budget and when you don't care the lack of fancy things than Mahan Air is the airline for you.,positive,en

Went up the street to spend that for fear that we would be stuck there for another hour. The food is good but it's not really worth the frustration. We'll be back but if this kind of service happens again, I will sadly write this place off.",negative,en

"I am long time listener to Wolfley on the radio. I came in to this restaurant with really high hopes. My buddy and I went on Monday night, and while the deal is 20% off steaks on Monday nights, I went with the chicken fried chicken. My appetizer was really good, I had the golden ravioli. My buddy doesn't like ravioli in the least, but I had him try it fried, and he loved it. The multiple televisions had the Saints at the 49ers. A good mix of fans, who showed up mostly a little after kick off. For dinner, as I said previously I had the chicken fried chicken. It was dry, the mashed potatoes it came with were cold, but the gravy was good. My buddy had the buffalo chicken sandwich, and he liked the sauce on the chicken, but the roll was hard. The waffle fries were very good though. As the game progressed, by eyes got the better of me and I had to sample a dessert. I went with the cookies and cream. Hot chocolate chip cookie, Vanilla ice cream, Whipped cream. While I kicked myself after the fact for ordering a dessert, it was very good. One thing I didn't really understand was the lack of beer specials throughout the entire game. I guess Budweiser was 3 dollars for a pint until 7, but it is a football night... at a sports bar... Maybe I'm crazy, but I would expect at least a little more. \n\nThe food while not great, had some high points. My low point of the night was when the bill came. We politely asked the waitress to split the bill, and she obliged. When she brought the separate checks and I went through my itemized bill. The problem is that she brought 2 copies of my buddy's bill. Easily forgiven as human error, I'm happy to forgive. When I got her attention to explain the situation she proceeded to tell me that no, I was wrong and she gave me the right bill. That the 2 descriptions were not the same, and even if they were the change was the only thing that was different between the 2 and so just pay. Now... I've never punished a waitress for the food, or the ambiance, or anything of that sort. I pay her for her SERVICE. I am a 25-35% tipper. I work in customer service and understand how it can be difficult sometimes. This time she got 6% tip. I'm not a customer is always right kinda person, but admitting mistakes is a huge part of customer service. That was TERRIBLE customer service. \n\nAll of this was not a enough to dissuade me from coming again, although next time I will probably sit at the bar, as bartenders normally have a better understanding of customer service. \n\nI want to like Wolfley's, I really do. But as for now, I'm going to have to say I don't.",negative,en

"When put in charge of finding the hotel for a family gathering in celebration of a ""milestone"" birthday for one of my siblings I gulped and wondered how will I satisfy everyone's tastes? We all would be coming from all over the country. Choosing The Millennium Knickerbocker was the perfect fit and everyone told me I really ""hit this one out of the park""! The location is ideal; you are IN the city but not annoyed with the usual city noise. It is just around the corner from The Magnificent Mile with its shops, sights and restaurants. The Millennium is an older hotel but is in beautiful shape. The rooms were elegant and yet ""comfy"". The lobby's open-space bar area was ideal for our sit and gab fests and in the evening some musical entertainment for those who could keep their eyes open after a busy day in the city. Staff were helpful and yet not obtrusive. All 'n all, this was an ideal place to stay for a fun-filled celebration with family! Will stay here again when next in Chicago!",positive,en

"Overall, I would heartily recommend this as a base from which to explore the city.
Stayed here for a few days. Though not very large, the room was comfortable. Lighting a little dim. Cool rotating shower head.
Short walk to the subway, good restaurants, and Central Park.
Staff were cheerful and friendly without being pushy and condescending as can happen in NYC.
Good and free wifi.
The only thing I don't understand in a hotel of this caliber is a heating/cooling system that works without a thermostat. You have to keep waking up at night to turn the heating off and on as it simply blows air steadily like a fan.

"The floorplans of the room are good. I enjoy having a full kitchen so I can stock healthy food and snacks in my fridge. I was in this hotel for only 2 nights for a business trip so I didn't have to use the kitchen on the trip but that amenity would be great for a longer trip to the area.
The walls in this hotel are extremely thin. I could hear the entire conversations of the guests in rooms on either side of my room. Unfortunately, on my 2nd night, there was one group who had both rooms on either side of me and they decided to hold a raging party until 2am. Three calls to the front desk to complain produced no results, the party went on...and on...and on.
There are no vending or ice machines in the buildings. So if you want water, snacks, ice, you have to go back to the lobby building (a separate building with the lobby, breakfast room, exercise room). Due to major t-storms and a tornado warning the 2nd night I was there, I had to forego my usual bottle of water at bedtime because I had forgotten to pick one up while I was out, and couldn't get to the lobby building safely. This is a pretty poor design, if you ask me. A simple vending machine is expected when you stay in a hotel (at least in my opinion).
The a/c unit in my room smelled of burning electric wires every time it clicked on. A call to the front desk assured me this was normal. Normal? Really?
The breakfast is your typical ""free hotel breakfast"". They do offer rubbery eggs and greasy sausage links but the two containers were out of food both mornings when I went down for b'fast. They were making more to refill them, but they never were refilled while I was there for about 30 minutes. You have a selection of 5 different sugary cereals, oatmeal packets, pre-wrapped sugary danish type things. The ""fresh fruit"" they brag of is a bowl of overripe bananas and nothing more. Their OJ and Apple juice is that from concentrate stuff that comes out of the machine. Barely any actual fruit in either, I couldn't even finish a small 6oz OJ it was so sugary and just plain bad. The coffee was decent, but I didn't go for my typical 2nd cup, and opted to swing by a real coffee shop on my way to my meeting.
The exercise room is small but functional for a quick workout. You have 2 treadmills, 1 stairmaster, and some free weights. They offer a cabinet of towels and free water (that was the best deal of all if you ask me). The a/c did seem to be faulty or just turned really high, the room was warm to begin with so I think I got an extra oomph to my 30 minutes on the treadmill since I was sweating far more than I normally would!
Overall, it was fine for a quick business trip but if I was going to have to stay a full week, I would have found another hotel by the 3rd night to finish out my trip.
PS: Oh, and I forgot to mention the huge ants crawling up the wall by my bed the night of the storm. I was on the 2nd floor and still had a bug problem. Gross.",negative,en
"I've been wanting to try the Aloft for a while and was happy to do so in Jacksonville. Having never been in one, I heard they were contemporary and very trendy. And...it was. It had a cool vibe and contemporary decor...in a chain sort of way. I don't mind the trendy decor at all, but it lacked an overall comfort level for our taste. It seemed a bit like it was really trying too hard to be ""cool.""
The bed was super comfortable. I sent Aloft an email wanting information on the mattress because it was so comfortable. My husband and I slept like babies.
The decor was fairly minimal which I was fine with. My husband prefers something a little more ""comfortable"" feeling and traditional. The closet was across the sink area which was open and in sight when you walked in the door. Also, the closet ""spaces"" did not have doors and just had drapes over them. This sink/closet space was viewable immediately upon entering. If you were traveling with a group and may have other people coming and going in and out of your room, it would be difficult to keep that area looking organized. Also, the light switches were messed up. The single switch plate which was accessible as soon as you walked in had three switches, but just one swith worked. It operated all of the lights in the room. So, turning the bathroom light on would also turn on the bedroom area light. Not good if people are getting up and getting ready at separate times.
The staff seemed very nice if not a little stressed. We took the shuttle back and forth to town center which was very nearby. It’s a huge retail center that would be a big attraction for visitors because of the numerous restaurants and high-end retail shops. However, both times we headed over there the shuttle driver didn't know where to go. I had to use my GPS on my phone to show him. On one of the return trips, the shuttle was prompt. On the other return trip, we called and told the desk staff exactly where we were with nearby roads and businesses, but the shuttle driver went back to where we were dropped off three hours prior. (It's a huge outdoor retail center so we had shopped and were at a different location - which we clearly specified when we called the shuttle.)
The clincher was the shuttle we had requested for 6:40 a.m. We called the day prior and made the request. We arrived at 6:35 and let the desk know we were there for the shuttle. By 6:45, no shuttle. I informed the desk that we had a 7 a.m. meeting and she said with exasperation that she's trying but that they didn't know we needed a shuttle and they had to find a driver. A few minutes later a driver came down (who told us he wasn't usually the driver) and took us to our meeting 5 minutes away. We were ten minutes late.",positive,en

"This hotel is in a tremendous location with restaurants, nightlife, beautiful neighborhoods and shopping all a short walk away. So, we were very optimistic about this hotel. Check in went well with very nice people assisting from the front door to the front desk. Unfortunately, when we got off the elevator and went to our room, we were hit by the smell of cigarette smoke. The smell was only slightly less prominent in our corner suite at the end of the hallway.
We immediately called the front desk and asked if we had accidently been placed in a smoking room and could they move us. After several phone calls to the front desk we were told that the hotel was booked and the best they could do was refresh the room for us - which turned out to be a spray with Glade (which we held onto and frequently used over the weekend as the smoking continued in the rooms down the hall). Very disappointing. Fortunately, it was a beautiful weekend in Chicago and we minimized our time in the room.

"I was not particularly thrilled with this place. In the end, my nails looked fine but the environment was dirty. Especially around the sink area.

So with one half polished hand, I reached around to find my wallet.

In her autobiography, Russell apologized for the movie's number ""Lookin' for Trouble"" because it was supposedly so risque--nowadays you could show it on The Disney Channel. (By the way, said autobiography has a jaw-dropping photo of Russell in a bikini, far sexier than anything",negative,en

"After being told that hotel guests had access to fitness facilities nearby, we find out after checking in that these ""nearby"" facitlities are 6+ blocks away.
When I am traveling on vacation with my young kids, it's tough to fit in some time to exercise so I try to keep the time I am away doing that as short as possible. So now I have to spend nearly 25 minutes walking back and forth to a local club that costs me $11 to use each time.
I travel several dozen times a year -- mostly for business and a few times for pleasure -- and to me nearby fitness facilities mean an elevator ride away or at most across the street.
So today I barely had time to try to fit this in and trek off to the local club only to be told that I cannot use their facilities because I don't have ID with me -- of which the hotel made no mention that it would be required. So I end up out walking around for nearly half an hour and don't get time to get in some exercise because that would mean me being gone another hour and a half from my wife and kids. Hardly what they expect from me on a family vacation.
Other comments:
- it was -physically impossible to take a shower in our bathroom without flooding the floor with water because a large gap between the shower stall and the wall. It was a pain in the neck to have to mop up after every single shower which required us calling to ask for more towels and bath mats.
- Their coffee is terrible. It tasted like it was made with grounds used for the second time.

"In Hong Kong, 1962, the editor Chow Mo-wan (Tony Leung Chiu Wai) and his wife, and the secretary Su Li-Zhen Chan (Maggie Cheung) and her husband simultaneously move to an old building. Each couple has just rented a room in apartments on the same floor. Their wife and husband stay most of the time away from home, and Chow and Li-Zhen have the same habits: they like kung-fu stories and noodles and soap from a restaurant nearby the building. Their close contact becomes friendship and a sort of platonic and repressed love. Later they realize that their mates are having an affair, Chow falls in love with Li-Zhen, but her shyness and probably repressed condition of married woman keeps her love in a platonic level. 'In the Mood for Love' is a very slow, beautiful, melancholic and romantic love story, with a wonderful photography and soundtrack and a very unusual edition. The film had not had a screenplay, and the actors were never sure about what they would be shooting. Later, the director edited his story based on the footages. When Chow moves to Singapore, there is a gap of many years in the story until 1966, when its conclusion is intentionally open and not well defined, leaving questions such as who is the boy with Li-Zhen.

"膨らみが悪くファンだけ流用
普段XLとか2Lとかの上着をちょうどよく着てるのですが、今回は他の方のレビューを参考にXXXLを購入（それでも小さいかも？と言う懸念を持ちながら購入）。 空調服って言うとまずイメージするようなミシュランマンみたいなシルエットになることを想像していましたが、こちはのラッシュガードはかなり細身のシルエットで、風をはらんでもあまり膨らむ感じにはなりませんでした。 やはり小さかったのかと試しにうちの奥さん（細身）着てもらってもああいう風船みたいな膨らみ方はしませんでした（空気が抜けにくいようにウエスト等絞って試してます）。 シルエットがそういうラインで作られてるのでは？と思います。 空気が回らないと思うように涼しくならなかった為返品も考えましたが、今回はファン部分を流用、ワークマンで買ってきたウインドブレーカーに取り付けてみました。いわゆる空調服のシルエットになり満足です。 バッテリーレスに関しては手持ちのモバイルバッテリーが使えるので、この形式の方が便利なのでは？と思うくらいでした。",negative,ja
"Radiant Inc is an incredibly talented photography team located in Las Vegas, Nevada.

Have you always wanted to channel your inner pinup? Radiant Inc works with a team of talented hair and makeup artists, even wardrobe stylists to make that happen. \n\nShoots start at $150, which is a bargain for what you get, many other photographers prices start at double that!!

"The plot of this enjoyable MGM musical is contrived and only occasionally amusing, dealing with espionage and romance but the focus of the film is properly pointed upon the tuneful interludes showcasing the enormously talented and athletic tap dancing Eleanor Powell, abetted by Tommy Dorsey and his orchestra, featuring Ziggy Elman, Buddy Rich and Frank Sinatra. Red Skelton shares top billing with Powell, and he and sidekick Bert Lahr are given most of the comedic minutes, although Skelton is more effective when he, if it can be believed, performs as Powell's love interest, with Virginia O'Brien actually providing most of the film's humor as the dancer's companion. The technical brilliance of Powell is evidenced during one incredible scene within which Buddy Rich contributes his drumming skills, and which must be viewed several times in order to permit one's breathing to catch up with her precision. Director Edward Buzzell utilizes his large cast well to move the action nicely along despite the rather disjointed script with which he must deal, and permits Powell's cotangent impossibilities to rule the affair, as is appropriate.",positive,en

Bangkok Don Meuang to Phuket. I have flown budget airlines in Europe and all i can describe is you get what you pay for and the airlines try to make more money from you selling you food drink and duty free at inflated prices. So what a refreshing change to be welcomed aboard and helped to my seat by friendly staff. Legroom was adequate and the aircraft was in excellent clean condition. Ten minutes into the flight the cabin crew handed out a small snack and a drink to everyone unheard of in Europe. Then there was a drinks trolley run which was reasonably priced for coffee and soft drinks. Then they came round with Nok Air merchandise but there was no high pressure sales patter going on it was all very relaxed. The captain kept us informed of progress in Thai and English. We will be flying with Nok Air again for sure could not fault it at all well done!!!!!!,negative,en

There is a chair in the corner for the desk but there isn't room to put the chair. You have to sit on the bed and lean over to use the desk. The suitcases must be set on their end and put along the wall. There is nowhere else to put them. There is a tiny closet that has a little curtain on it (and the luggage won't fit in there).

"Clark Gable plays a con man who busts into the life of hard-boiled dame Jean Harlow. He tries to sucker her while she brushes him off with her tough-gal attitude. Despite their cynicism and cons they fall in love. When Gable accidentally kills a man during a sting he runs out leaving loyal Harlow to women's prison where she discovers she's pregnant. Anita Loos' and Howard Emmett Rogers' writing is excellent throughout with many well-drawn and surprising characters (including a Jewish socialist woman inmate and a black woman inmate and her preacher father played with hardly a trace of stereotype). Gable and Harlow show their mettle as actors adding telling nuances and quirks to their characters that send them beyond the typical Gable and Harlow roles. And the direction is much better than you'd expect from Sam Wood. One beautiful shot has Harlow being inducted into the prison, then led out into a surprisingly snowy courtyard as the camera tracks after her. This is one of the best of both the ""criminals in love"" and ""women's prison"" genres and has some of the best hard-boiled dialogue ever written.",positive,en

"My husband and I made our first trip to Boston with our 2 small children (ages 4 and 18 months) August 5-9th. After extensive research, we opted for the Parker House based on its location, price and its rating as one of ""Boston's most family friendly hotels"". We hit the nail on the head with this hotel. We originally booked a deluxe room for $325 per night, but noticed a few weeks later the rate had gone down about 25%. Instead of staying in the deluxe room, we opted to get a king bedroom suite for the same original price as the deluxe room was. I called the hotel ahead of time to ask about a small refrigerator. Since we had small children, they gave us one to use for FREE! We arrived and were immediately impressed with the beautiful hotel, the staff, bellmen, etc. About 10 minutes after we arrived in our rooms, someone knocked on the door with milk and warm cookies for the kids. We continued to be impressed with free coffee each morning delivered to our door, the option to have 2 clothing items pressed, and the $15 bar credit each night. The knowledgeable concierge, friendly and thorough housekeeping, the turn down service, etc were all great. On Monday morning I could hear trash trucks, but other than that, we had no issue with noise (however my children are quite loud:). The location was perfect with our children because we could stop sightseeing in the middle of the day for naps back at the hotel. We enjoyed Boston Common being so close by. We loved this hotel experience, and we will visit again.",positive,en

"I stayed at this property in November 2011 for an event being held at the convention center, which is a comfortable walk away. The regular rates for this W are befuddlingly astronomical -- I got a Starpicks rate and still feel like I overpaid for what I received. The hotel is, in the typical W vein, very trendy -- this was apparent when I passed a woman in the lobby wearing shorts with suspenders over a neon-green bra. There were a ton of weddings in Austin that weekend (11/11/11), and unfortunately the room next to mine hosted an afterparty once all the bars closed down. Very unpleasant, though the hotel cannot be faulted for people's lack of sense.
My main gripe with the property was the poor service I received. The gentleman who checked me in was downright snooty and acted like I wanted a piece of the moon itself when I asked about the availability of my Starwood upgrade. My bill was also a complete mess upon checkout, and the desk clerk kept arguing with me about it until I actually pulled out my iPhone and started adding things to show him the inaccuracies. Then he finally deigned to get a manager, which took an eternity. Overall not a huge deal and it all got settled eventually, but that's half an hour of my life I'll never get back.",negative,en
"What can't I say about this place? It is the best Mexican food in town. The tacos, tortas, burritos, and carne asada are all amazing. The chips, salsa, and the indispensable green sauce are all great and manage to rise above just being food while you wait - they are guaranteed to still be eaten throughout the meal. The only bad menu item I've ever had is the enchilada, which wasn't terrible, but simply okay. The service is perfectly fitting and the environment and location of the restaurant is equally good. I can't speak for authenticity, but everyone else claims it is. It's worth the extra distance from pretty much any local Mexican restaurant you could go to.",positive,en

"We went for a family stay---2 adults, 1 child---and our stay was just OK. Our room was adequate but nothing exceptional. It was clean and the bath appeared to have been partly updated but the whole hotel still feels a bit dated. Even where they've refreshed things they've only half way done it---left old light plates, old hvac fittings, old doors or whatever that just defeat their efforts. We had breakfast included in our room price and Thank Goodness we did, b/c the first day they did not have it noted at the restaurant that it was included and I had to sign the check and then have the front desk remove the $70 charge. That's right $69.23 for 2 adults, 1 child buffet breakfast including tax ant 21% gratuity. And no, I didn't add 21% b/c the service was so fabulous--especially not for a buffet where I served myself---21% gratuity is automatically added to all hotel food charges. You will also pay a ""resort charge"" for each day's stay (9% of your nightly room charge---better incentive to find a good deal). Indoor pool is gross--just looks dirty. Outdoor pool ok. Mini golf really bad shape. Nature trail not well marked and many other trails crossing through. Golf--well that is a highlight--if you've got the chance to go on a company paid boondogle--Take it. Lots of tennis courts. Do the kid's scavenger hunt and the reward is a free dessert in the Wine Bar. The spa has great service and you definitely pay for it. Most treatments are around $150/ hr. Not unusual for a high end resort hotel spa. However, the common facilities---whirlpool, steam, sauna, relaxation room etc. are pitiful and not what you expect at a spa with those prices. All are old and small. Also, the series of doors, stairs, small rooms and multiple check in desks add to the downmarket feel. Overall, I rated the resort as Average because it is. It just felt like I was paying for Excellent and it is not.",positive,en

"My husband and I stayed at St. Francis on 3/5 and 3/6. He surprised me for our 1st year anniversary. We live in the Bay Area and I work in San Francisco so I'm familiar with the property and the fact that most SF hotels are small, small bathrooms etc. We stayed in room 409, which is a suite in the original (old) building. The room was charming, nice decor, beds were comfortable. However the decor showned serious wear and tear. The couch was stained, the bathroom, while pleasant, was small and there was no area to place your sundries. The bathoom ceiling had some mold and the frame around the bathoom mirror (like a picture frame) had some old, scary toothpaste stains! The tv cabinet had some dings in it too. I did expect the room to be somewhat noisy and we had 'musical enterainment' across the street (rock band one night, bongo drums the next). City ordinance says music should end at 10:30, however both bands played well past 12:30 on both nights. While the staff did respond to my complaint, there was the attitude ""Well, what can we do about it, they are not on Westin property?"" That may be true but when you spend $249 a night for your anniversary, you expect double payne windows and maybe a warning that the room is noisy. Street noise is fine...but not a band playing. After a long discussion and the manager admitting others had complained, I was give a $30 per night credit.
I still enjoyed my anniversary but I wouldn't stay at the hotel again. It's old and needs some work. On the positive, check out the Omni (newer) or Hotel Drisco. Good locations as well.",negative,en

A Rod Stewart look-a-like was playing music (I thought it was really him, still unsure). The prices weren't all that bad, but then again we split the bill between 4 ladies so it made it like $15 per person. My friend got a drink in an awesome Cabo Wabo glass and they let her keep it which was really nice and a great souvenir! My only complaint is not being able to talk to my friends we were literally texting each other to communicate. We asked to be seated inside but our waiter couldn't even hear us so we all gave up and just pointed at what we wanted to order. While waiting for the food we got to watch all the early drunks yell up at all of us at Cabo Wabo which was sort of funny it was only like 11pm - not to mention the Bellagio fountain show is like right across the street so a fountain show, live music and food.

"Here's how small: we had to close the door in order to put our bags down.

But for $75 in Murray Hill I should complain?
TIP: ask to NOT have a room at the top of the stairs. Next time, I will gladly pay more for a room away from the landing, as someone thought it would be a good idea to tile that area so that it amplifies sound. There was construction going on so the rooms might even be nicer in the near future. No quieter, but nicer.

The inner locks would definately be of no effect if someone managed to bypass the bolt, and that night, a friday night, someone did try my door and attempt to jimmy or unlock the bolt, and left when they heard movement in the room. I contacted the office, was told security would be informed and would come to see me, none of which happened, as security was never informed, and no record of my call was ever made by the night staff.

"Plot/Story/Characters: 2 StarsThis is a very short story. It felt more like the first couple of chapters of a book rather than a complete story.

There was no resolution, the climactic scene was a girl-fight including hair pulling, and there was no character development or growth. Readers were introduced to Zyra and her arch nemesis, then left hanging. It feels like an unfinished story, not a cliffhanger, just not finished. The quest was not completed, no portion of the quest was completed.Writing Style: 4 StarsThe language used was normal for a science fiction novel.

"Las ilustraciones no son adecuadas
La clasificación de lecturas por edad no me suele gustar mucho, puesto que no debe privar al niño de una buena historia solo porque no ha llegado a la edad marcada por la editorial. Por eso compré este libro para mi hijo de 6 años, ya que le encanta todo de los caballeros y castillos. Pero no pudimos ni leer una página. Al hojear el libro y ver las ilustraciones no quiso volver a abrirlo porque había caballeros caídos y con muchas manchas de sangre por todos lados. Considero que las ilustraciones no son muy acertadas. Tenemos otros libros de caballeros donde el tema de guerra y muertes se han sabido presentarse de mejor manera.

"The Four Seasons in Denver is one noisy hotel. It's horribly expensive, and it is NOISY. Right now, there is a party going on at the pool. It is past 10:30PM, and the drums are blaring. I've moved rooms. The manager admits the party is still going on, but the manager just told me with a complete straight face that the music stopped at 10:00. He can't hear it.
But his guests can.

"I was there for a conference from May 22-28. I would give it a 3.5 because of some issues, but some issues were probably specific to our situation.
The Good:
1. newly refurbished, modern furniture etc.
2. very clean room
3. very nice staff
4. cute bar, although a little small
5. nonsmoking
6 Starbucks in front
7. good lunch restaurant
8. great location
The Bad:
1. Even though this was a conference and there were 4 of us in the room, we had a difficult time getting them to guaranteee 2 beds
2. Beds were soft and there were too many pillows.
3. Too much cuteness without practicalities - e.g., the shower stall door went from floor to ceiling, but opening it produced a lot of noise in the bedroom; lots of metal bathroom fixtures (soap dish, garbage can), which also made noise if touched; only one towel rack in bathroom, so we couldn't conserve our towels
3. Housekeeping continually left us only decaf coffee. They quickly brought us more when we called, but this happened reapeatedly.
4. We were overcharged for internet use and for parking (we didn't have a car). It took a long time for them to sort this out when we departed.
5. Bar closed early on Memorial Day - we were told it was last call, but then people (apparently bartender's friends) came in and were served.
Special Issue
We asked for a fridge and microwave because of a medical condition requiring preparing own food. They provided a fridge, but the only outlet in which it coudl be plugged was controlled by a hall-switch by the door. Even though we put a sign over the switch, housekeeping kept turning it off. Hotel couldn't provide a microwave and told us that the Executive Floor was still under construction (which it wasn't). My husband had to call them to come get his food and take it downstairs to be microwaved. Bit of a pain, but in the future we know to find a hotel with a kitchette.",negative,en

我是亚马逊的忠实顾客群中的一员，虽然某宝在中国比较流行，但是我一直认为亚马逊不会有假货，虽然东西贵一点。本着这个思想，我一直在亚马逊购物，还一直选择亚马逊自营产品购买！作为一个妈妈，母婴用品在亚马逊也是我的首选，我不知道是的对亚马逊的信任，还是我的大意，我一直没有怀疑过会有假货，也一直觉得都用的很好，直到这一次的购物。 2015年3月30日，订单编号 C03-4510442-8561649，我在亚马逊购买婴儿花王纸尿裤一包，到货后我打开包装，惊奇的发现比以前在亚马逊买的都要薄，正好上次（3月15日订单编号 C03-6109563-8124044）买的一包还剩余一片，我就拿过来比较一下，果然这次买的要薄很多，另外棉质很不均匀，有些地方整个就没有夹层，我以为不是一个供货商，检查了一下，都是东莞的同一个地方！我有觉得会不会是不同的批次，但是遗憾的是还是同一批次！（照片为证）现在这种情况只有2个可能，两包都是假货，或者其中一包是假货，我不得不承认我信任的亚马逊也有假货，我自以为比麦芽宝贝，比淘宝，比京东，比其它网站都要贵一点的亚马逊，不会有假货的亚马逊也卖了假货。 接着就进入了无比生气的维权阶段，无论我是打电话投诉，还是写邮件，没有人理你，说好的回访，也没有回访，最后的说法是让我自己找供货商，我表示我没办法找供货商，我在亚马逊买的亚马逊配送的物品，怎么找供货商？那么亚马逊在我购物过程中扮演了什么角色？最后的最后亚马逊客服给我的回话是，随便我上哪儿投诉去吧，他们是不管这个事情！！！！ 我现在还在打12315，我会一直一直打，或者我实在没有精力了，或者这个事情会有合理的解决办法，但是亚马逊，我不会再来买东西了。 最后，各位亲，我朋友从日本回来给我人肉背回花王纸尿裤，我可以担保我在这里买的每一包都是假的！ 心疼各位宝妈的那颗给宝宝最好的心，也心疼宝宝们的屁屁！,negative,zh

"We came here because it looked awesome from an ad, and from the website. We really wanted to check out the cool touchscreen tables, and play some games or whatever on them.

Only two or three of the tables were even using them, the rest just had drinks and jackets thrown over them. Move over people if you aren't using it.\n\nAlso, the drinks were bad. My vodka-cranberry was decent, but whatever vodka they used was really bad quality. My friends ordered long island iced teas, which were simply disgusting. Way too much for a disgusting drink. \n\nThe bar is a neat and really modern little section, but its plopped down in the middle of the casino. It's too small to really enjoy.

"Our initial trip to this highly rated (Zagat) Churrascaria did not begin well when the greeter did not seat us immediately or even after 10 minutes despite the fact that we had a reservation. Three parties who arrived after us were seated ahead of us. Explanation given was that they wanted to clear a nice table for us....hmmm. A comped desert from the manager soothed our feelings however. \n\nThese style of Brazilian steakhouses which have sprung up around the country in recent years charge about $40 -$50 for an endless serving of 20 or 30 different types of grilled beef, lamb, chicken and fish. You basically strap on your feed bag and let 'er rip. Quality of the meat in these establishments is hit or miss and quantity comes before quality here. Lots of sides are included. The meal is actually pretty good if you contain yourself and select the different cuts of meat wisely. At Via Brazil, we liked the filet mignon wrapped in bacon, the NY strip, the chicken drumsticks, the beef ribs, the flank steak, and grilled asparagus. Suggest you avoid the garlic steak and tri tip -- tough and chewy during our visit. Some of the meats were over seasoned -- too salty -- and the cooks need to have slightly gentler hands on their salt shakers. \n\nA salad bar is included and I would say it was average at best and inferior to what we have experienced at Fogo de Chao and Texas de Brazil, two competitor chains. The selection of cold and hot salads was not as varied and numerous as we have seen elsewhere. The selections they did have were tasty and fresh however. \n\nOur party of three ordered the Sterling meal and the Prime meal plus an ala carte salad and fish entree. The Sterling meal costs an extra 10 dollars and there are premium meat selections (lamb chops, shrimp, NY strip) that come with it. In my opinion, worth it. \n\nA pretty good meal and pretty good table service and I recommend Via Brazil without reservation. Decent value for a good meal, not perfect but a nice restaurant nonetheless.",neutral,en

This hotel is the biggest piece of recycled garbage I have been in for many years. There is a SIGNIFICANT mold problem here that is either being overlooked or not properly addressed.

"The Hilton Manhattan East is beautiful with lots of old touches. The lobby is small, but there is an atmosphere around its days as the Tudor. There are lots of quirks (small elevators, small hallways, small conference facilities), so if you're a business traveler used to the Hilton brand, this probably isn't the place for you.
The front desk staff was efficient, but not overly friendly. They failed to let me know on check-in that there are two towers to the hotel. Being in the south tower, I went downstairs to find offices and a hallway full of used towels (yuck) only to be re-directed. Once I got to my room, it was well appointed and comforting. There is a sincere amount of construction being done in the area, and the hotel is covered in scaffolds (including this corner room upgrade).
The bathrooms are in major need of an update. Mine included a Jacuzzi tub, a bidet and a toilet. But all needed updating. Despite the full page of instructions in the shower, I failed to master the exact cadence of what was needed for a not-too-hot shower.
All in all, I probably won't stay here again, but it's nothing against the property itself. I just prefer larger facilities with a little less charm. But that makes me American, right?",neutral,en

"We booked the hotel on Hotwire, I was having a hard time finding a room anywere else under $150-200 a night, we got the Tremont for $92. The reviews on tripadvisor are very + and -. Here's our opinion of it. It has a great location right off of Michigan avenue and across the street from he Hancock Center. The hotel is old, the elevator is slow and the rooms are in definite need of repair, however the room was clean and safe and I knew when I booked it that I wasn't going to get the Four Seasons for $92 a night. I also didn't book a room on Michigan avenue to spend all my time there. When we go to Chicago we spend very little time in our room we sleep and change clothes that's about it. It definitely served its purpose for us. I do have to disagree with Hotwires rating of three stars it was more of a two star hotel. While I probably wouldn't actively seek this hotel out to reserve if I got it again on Hotwire I would stay. A few years ago we stayed at the Intercontinental and loved it, however it's prices have definitely gone up they were wanting $250 a night (we paid $65 last time) and we got the Tremont for $92, so the Tremont worked for our budget and served its purpose so if you get in on Hotwire or Priceline don't be to worried as long as you are prepared for it to be old don't plan on spending a lot of time here.",positive,en

In this restaurant's defense, I was referred there to try the ribs--and I ordered something else--The combo platter with hot links, pulled pork, and briskett; all were good, however I wouldn't order the pulled pork again, just didn't impress me. Baked beans & Macaroni & cheese were absolutely wonderful. \n\nThe service, well it was just slow and unnattentive. We're talking about serving food that is 100% pre-cooked, so after the order is placed it should simply be the time it takes to plate the food and bring it to the table. 40-mins? I counted six customers in the place.\n\nI was hoping for a good hole-in-the wall BBQ joint, but what I got was a chain restaurant, and if I wanted that, I would've gone to Lucille's.",negative,en

"I borrowed this movie despite its extremely low rating, because I wanted to see how the crew manages to animate the presence of multiple worlds. As a matter of fact, they didn't - at least, so its seems. Some cameo appearance cut rather clumsily into the movie - that's it, this is what the majority of viewers think. However, the surprise comes at the end, and unfortunately then, when probably most of the viewers have already stopped this movie. I was also astonished when I saw that the Brazilian-Portuguese title of this movie means ""Voyage into Death"". This is THE spoiler.That this movie is about a young girl who goes ALONE onto this boat (on reasons that are completely unclear), you understand only in the last 5 minutes. When you start the movie with the English title ""Haunted Boat"" in your head, you clearly think that the cameo appearances of strange figures are the ""ghosts"". But in reality, this movie is not like most other horror movies told from the distant writer-watcher perspective who can at almost any time differentiate between different levels of reality, it is told from the perspective of the young girl. We see her not alone, but together with the four friends because SHE sees them. We do not see that she is alone. So, the parallel worlds are not the cameo appearances flickering into the picture-stream, but the main story! We have at least two parallel worlds: The world in which the girl is and the world in which the 4 friends are. An intrusion of a third world is probably the young man with the medical skills who comes for a short time on the boat.I cannot get rid of the deep conviction that with this movie, the movie-makers ""cheated"" an audience of several thousand people by letting them believe that what they have done is more or less a sophomore film-student elaborate with hastily ""chosen"" pseudo-actors that have met just the night before the start of the shooting in a dump after at least twelve beers. How mistaken can one be! But in addition to this big surprise which one learns only in the very last minutes, the end that follows gives another surprise. The girl is saved by a crew in a helicopter and another boat. When she has recovered from her shock, she visits again the place at the harbor where she ascended the boat together with the four friends. And there they are again! They wave her to them from the boat which has already taken off shore. She jumps into the water, arrives at the boat - and they are away. Miraculously beautiful. It remembers me a bit to the end of a poem by a Rhetoromance writer: When I awoke, I saw Death standing at my bed. But I closed my eyes. When I opened them again - he was gone.",positive,en

"Пришли сегодня с семьей в данное заведение. Все началось с того что пришлось самому идти искать официанта, чтобы наш заказ приняли. Заказали 3 порции роллов и официант спросила как нам их принести, на одной тарелки или каждая порция роллов раздельно? Мы сказали чтобы принесли раздельно.В итоге официантка принесла все роллы на одной тарелке! Зачем тогда было вообще нас спрашивать об этом? Во время еды мы заметили, что во всех роллах был отчетливый вкус васаби, хотя в составе, который написан в меню этого не было. Далее я снова пошел искать официанта, чтобы нас рассчитали! В ответ на мой вопрос о том, что во всех роллах присутствует васаби, она сказала, что действительно так и все роллы теперь смазывают васаби, но меню старое и об этом там не написано. НО ОНА СКАЗАЛА ЧТО ВСЕХ ГОСТЕЙ ОНИ ОБ ЭТОМ ПРЕДУПРЕЖДАЮТ ЗАРАНЕЕ, ВИДИМО МЫ ДЛЯ НИХ НЕ БЫЛИ ГОСТЯМИ! После того как мы рассчитались, а мой разговор на эту тему не закончился, она просто демонстративно ушла, не решив конструктивно данную ситуацию, оставив нас на едине с данной проблемой. Также были маленькие размеры роллов, хотя на картинке из меню они совершенно другого размера, но видимо это снова проблемы старого меню, а не их. Но был хороший лимонад, хоть это радует. Да и хорошо, что аллергии на васаби ни у кого из нас не было, иначе было бы все куда трагичнее.",negative,ru

"I was traveling on a budget and I had a good deal for a two–day stay. The front desk was unhelpful and definitely not friendly at all. I asked for directions and for some restaurant suggestions, and the answers were ""sorry, I don't have dinner out very often, so I can't recommend any restaurant in the area "". I asked to borrow a staple for 5 minutes but I could only use it in the lobby. At early morning or late night the lobby access is closed and if you need something you have to walk out from the hotel using the parking lot access and re-enter the lobby from the front (waste of time and also potentially dangerous at night). I booked a room with an extra-bed, the extra bed was not there at our arrival. The room was extra-hot and we had to keep the old and loud a/c unit constantly on. In sum, I don't complain too much for the price, but I won't suggest this stay to anyone with decent expectation in terms of customer service and politeness.",negative,en

"Well, I don't even know where to start and sorry for being so late getting this review in. I had the fortunate opportunity to go to Gordon Ramsey Steakhouse on the Las Vegas Strip , September 13, 2012. One of the most amazing meals I've ever had and I want to share the experience, so that if you should ever have a chance to dine there, you should! \n\nEverything was just perfect and what started it off was the waiter, Donald (Donny)! I can still see his face and his attention to his job was impeccable. Yes, I know it is a pricey dinning experience, but you should go there and order the Beef Wellington. You will never forget it and after every bite that melts in your mouth, you will be wishing for it from now on! Also, make sure you don't leave without eating the Sticky Pudding! I can't remember the appropriate name, but that should be enough to get the right dessert.\n\nAnother highlight of the evening was Christina Wilson, that had just won Hell's Kitchen. That was the night she came in to start her new adventure. I got to meet her and she talked in length with me. Probably because I was seated at the top of the stairs where she was going up and down, so I calmly yelled to her to come over. Maybe it's a Texas thing! Sure didn't want her to get away! :) She was delightful and I'm praying she is doing well there, because she deserves to be.\n\nSo, make sure you go to Gordon Ramsey Steak, on the Las Vegas Strip and have a couple of good drinks, the Beef Wellington and Sticky Pudding!!! Enjoy and make sure when you make your reservations, try to ask for Donald (Donny) to be your waiter!!! Who knows, you might even get to meet Christina! You won't be disappointed, I promise!!! All the Best to All that reads this and Happy 2013!!!! \n \nJama from Lubbock, Texas",positive,en

"My sister and I came just because we read about this cafe having plantain chips, which we were craving. That being said, we can't speak for any other food, but these chips were so amazing, we had to get a second order. The black bean dip that came with it was especially tasty, and my sister, who doesn't like black beans at all, helped me eat it down to the bottom of the bowl.\n\nWe were a little put off by the stale, quiet atmosphere and lack of music. We were two of four in the small dining area and felt uncomfortable having conversation when the others could hear every word. \n\nThe only other thing that made our visit less than perfect was our waiter. He was really attentive to our needs (water, whether we needed anything else every once in a while, etc.), but standoffish/unfriendly for the most part.\n\nBottom line, I will be back again with an emptier stomach so I can enjoy the crunchy plantain chips, and try other delicious looking dishes here.",neutral,en

"Fado is a sad almost bluesy style of Portuguese Gypsy music that is heard repeatedly trough the movie. As explained by one of the main characters (Igor) it also means fate.Indeed it's fate that bring the two main characters Paco and Alex together and triggers the problems that ensue.On the whole I enjoyed it quite a bit. It starts out as an 'on the down and outs' drama/road movie an builds into a suspenseful thriller / road movie.There were two things that I found unrealistic that kept me from giving it a higher rating (I gave it an 8). The first is the major point of why did Alex give the stuff away. She was so desperate for cash that she sold her passport for a paltry sum and then she gives away things worth thousands to a stranger? Her explanation was unconvincing.

COPYING of everything they consider good, when they see it in another movies or countries or elsewhere. I think that this is a good example of making ""art"" and ""politics"" and ""horror"" and ""humor"" and ""film"" and money. And it remains me of the /One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest/, which can not be compared to this film in the way of ART and ACTORS and STORY and POLITICS. I think this film is boring.

Our party of 13 was quickly seated and our server gal was quick, friendly, and did an outstanding job of taking care of us.

It was smoked and tasty and my side of broccoli was cooked well (not over steamed). I am not a big fan of their BBQ sauces because they taste *really* sweet, but a little here and there was enjoyable.\n\nI think it is a great spot for a group lunch - we were seated quickly, served appropriately, had a filling meal, it was a good value, and easy with separate checks.",neutral,en

"My first review. I stayed at the Affinia Manhattan from december 29 - January 11th with 2 of my girl friends. We were a bit reluctant due to some of the reviews but we booked so late there weren't many other options over New Years. We were so happy with our stay. When we booked we booked for 3 people for the first 6 nights in a 2 bed room with a kitchenette. After those nights one of the girls left so we had organised to change to a 1 bed, room for the rest of the stay(as it was so much cheaper). Upon check in we were told that we could have the first room for the entirety of our stay! The lady was so helpful and we were so happy to not have to change rooms half way through!
We were in a beautiful room, bathroom was small which was hard for 3 girls but we worked it out.
THe concierge desk was always helpful, getting us tickets to broadway shows etc..
The Hotel bar was nice. The bar staff always friendly and happy.
Front Desk staff were always helpful as was the Bell Hop.
Right across from Penn Station, Starbucks and resturaunts. A nice easy walk to Times Square and surrounding area's.
Our only downside was that we were directly above a fire station which meant we had sirens going all day and all night but I'm pretty sure most of Manhattan is exactly the same.

"I'm all for supporting unique and individual places and would rather avoid large chains if possible. I was familiar with this hotel before I actually stayed here, and expected to love it. The Hotel Lawrence tried to approach a ""boutique"" style and ambiance, but unfortunately, the smart bathroom decor and shower fixtures could not overcome the temperature in the ""Junior Suite"" I booked, which was actually rigged up to a motion detector and would not go below 75 degrees. There was no hot water in the morning. Three unsolicited wake up calls beginning at 5:30 am were not welcome. The demeanor of the staff was marginal, as they came across as more streetwise than hospitable. I used to work in the hotel business and make generous allowances for shortcomings. I do not like to complain, and left a letter for the General Manager about my concerns, stating that if the problems I had encountered could be fixed, I would stay there again and make reservations on the spot. The letter has remained unanswered. His voice mailbox was also full for two weeks afterward. After experiencing these problems, I can only conclude that these are the actual standards of this hotel and they're not all that concerned about it. Since then I've stayed at the Hyatt and the Adolphus for nearly the same price I paid here and received a much finer experience at both places. My honest advice is to check around on the internet for similar rates elsewhere. You'll probably be smart to spend a few dollars more to avoid this hotel, or just as probably, find a lower rate at a hotel known for quality. Sorry to say, but staying here is a gamble at best.",negative,en

"Living in the metro Phoenix area all my life, I grew up with Monti's. Had family in town who also grew up with Monti's so we went out for dinner tonight. I wanted to remind them how great the bread is so they would move back. There were 12 of us total, and the service was a *bit* on the slow side, but I think our waiter handled it well considering there was another huge party going on tonight (85 people). \n\nThe bread is still great. Had their Monday special which is the filet mignon. It tasted wonderful, but just a bit on the salty side. The side of steamed vegetables consisted of two pieces of broccoli and two small carrot strips, so they could definitely stand to not skimp so much on the veggies. \n\nMostly we enjoyed going for nostalgia's sake- childhood memories, growing up and remembering the treat it was to go there for dinner.

"To say the least, I was excited about doing the Twilight helicopter tour of the Hoover Dam and the Strip. But, I left disappointed. \n\nPros: \n-Went up in a helicopter\n-Picked us up in the limo\n-Beautiful facility\n-30 tour (versus 10-15 with competitors)\n-Nice narration every now and of places we passed\n-Friendly piolt\n\n\nCons:\n-wasn't aware we were going to be sharing our experience with other people\n-Drivers give you whip-lash (maybe that's not their fault with all the stoplight and speed bumps, but I was definitely ready to get out)\n-Once we got there and checked in, we didn't get on the helicopter for 30-45 minutes\n-There were 7 people in one helicopter - completely uncomfortable and squished. This was bar far my biggest complaint. This impacted our views, picture taking, as experience. When we finally went over the strip, we weren't on the window side of the strip and didn't really get to see it - didn't event get a picture of it. We weren't on the side of the Hoover Dam when we approached it, and when the pilot turned around, it went by so fast we didn't even get a clear picture. \n\nIt was an experience, but i can't say I would recommend this place to friends. I would do another helicopter ride, but I would be certain that they didn't stuff us in like sardines - it just ruined it. For $250/person, I would have rather spent my money at the casino.",negative,en

The lobby is spacious although our rooms weren't ready as requested and we had to queue since the check in desk seemed to be staffed by 1 person!!! This being a nightmare for our 14 month old who needed some rest after a 10 hour journey!! . Our room was on the 25th Floor and had great reviews of Philadelphia and in the distance the famous steps Sly climbed in his 'Rocky' Film.
The hotel is in a decent location, it's what you should expect - the room was large but alas looked a little dated - it is spacious although the bed spread did smell a bit.
All in all not that bad we may have been lucky and got a nicer room than other reviewers who have fared worse experiences in the past.",negative,en

"On the pictures it looked quite different from...:) Save the money for something else..
Was very disappointed with the room, for so much money would you expect a bit more, it is really a 4star hotel?
And then the many hidden costs, 1 hour parking is 24-42 dollars! (3x more expensive as the renting!!!)
If you want internet / WiFi, it costs again (about 20 U.S. if you want an acceptable speed), and you can only connect one device, for an example: if you have an iPhone and one Notebook, you need to pay the fee twice! Nearly in all hotels / restaurants / supermarkets etc. in the U.S. you can get WiFi for free, but not in the Westin Boston Waterfront 4*!
If you want to have something from the view of Boston, you must be at least in the 10th floor, otherwise you see only a few ugly buildings...
The swimming pool is difficult to reach and very small.
TV is annoying: between each channel tedious hotel advertising.
In the bathroom the floor is cold and it is fully air conditioned.
To switch the lamps on in your room, you need almost to be a scout, the switches are hidded in the lamp and you get full blinded when you switch on (Please ask for sunglasses on the desk).
The rooms are very ring of hearing, you can hear other guests talking in the hallway or walking steps from your bed. Every door bangs, as if it were your own roomdoor.
On the morning from 7 clock, you wake up with infinite door knocking in all rooms, this can drive one quite mad.

"Extremely over priced!
These mats are extremely over priced, and while excellent floor coverage, and they appear to be good quality, they look and feel cheap, due to the plastic nature of the materials. I prefer, and I am used to, that rubber mat feeling, where your feet do not slip and slide on the floor area, like they do on these mats. These are not rubber mats, but are recycled plastic(must be cheap to make, and high profit). In my 2009 Camry, the passenger side fits perfect, however, the driver's side has an annoying gap or buckle on the vertical right side, so they do not fit perfect there, and thus, are not a perfect ""laser cut"" fit, on my car. I have other high quality Weathertech products that are great, but these are not! I almost returned them, but they do have good coverage on the floor area, and I did not want to go through the trouble of returning such bulky items.",negative,en
"Disney, the film name that once stood for all things innocent and suitable for all ages, has finally started to realise that to survive it needs to become more diverse. Such diversity has been very apparent in the last couple of years. Films like ""Tarzan"" and ""The Emperor's New Groove"" have made an attempt to move away from the traditional song-driven routine of Disney's past and into new, uncharted territory. ""Atlantis"" is the boldest step yet, but we have to remember: This is STILL Disney. The first ever serious film to come out of Disney's animation studio is a major achievement for them - in fact it's so serious it makes it into PG territory. Perhaps why a lot of families were scared off from seeing it this past summer.But despite the more mature subject matter, this is still a film that Disney wanted to draw in the families with, not just mature audiences, so the plot had to be kept simple enough for children to understand, but interesting enough to take it away from the realms of ""The Little Mermaid"" et al.So what we get is actually a potentially detailed plot, unfortunately suffering the blow of being condensed into a 96-minute movie. Ultimately, this is an action film about Atlantis, not about the exposition preceding it, so we are whisked through the first half hour with as many sequences bombarding the screen as is possible without losing coherency. Suspend your disbelief of how the characters get from point A to point B so quickly, you're unlikely to find an animated film that detailed coming out of Hollywood! If you want epic levels of detail in the plot, turn to James Cameron's ""Titanic"". Both films feature a boat in some manner.And let's talk about love, shall we? Yes, as with a lot of films, the lead male (one Milo Thatch, a bumbling archaeologist) and lead female (Kida, the clichéd Atlantian princess) are set to fall in love with each other. But what I found was not as clichéd as I was expecting. By film's end, for once, the characters touching/feeling/kissing sequence was far more subdued. There's various points in the film where the attraction grows, but it's just not in the ballpark of, say, ""The Little Mermaid"" (A good thing).You may have grasped that this is a rather clichéd film. Correct. You have your leading hero and heroine, backed up by more than half a dozen crew members who go on the expedition, all being given their moments during the film. Numerous other characters appear, take up the few minutes of screentime, then disappear. It doesn't take a genius to do the maths  a 96-minute film with a focus on action and visuals, and with a considerable cast, has very little time to expand the characters to any major extent. So what does it rely on? Clichés, and lots of them. Every character emulates something that has been done a thousand times before. You have the bumbling scientist, the attractive princess, the square-jawed colonel, the rich eccentric, the maniacal sleazebag, the Russian femme fatale  need I go on?I don't know why this got to anyone  I found the tongue-in-cheek nature of this film quite amusing. Alright, this is meant to be a serious flick, but do you really expect Disney to give up every single trait of their history? At least the writers have tried to come up with consistently witty dialogue, and sometimes it even is a little inspired.But in the end it's those big stunning visuals that put the icing on this cake. The CGI animation is truly amazing in places, and doesn't dwarf the characters, which was a flaw that let the recent ""Titan A.E."" down. Speaking of characters, Disney hired an outside comics industry artist to create the designs, bringing an anime style to the film. Infact the visual presentation of the film as a whole owes a lot to anime, much more so than any previous Disney outing. This resulted in a conflict with fans of the Japanese anime, ""Nadia"", for the film's overall similarities with said cartoon series. Having not seen this anime, I can't comment.With picture, there is sound. Gary Rydstrom heads up the sound team, and what a soundtrack! From the opening shot the sound stage is alive and is a treat. James Newton Howard treats us to a dynamic musical score, which compliments the film in every way, never sounding out of place and always helping to build the tension or subdue it.Perhaps I missed the point of what the creators intended. To me, the film conveys that it's an adventure thrill ride, albeit with a more serious tone than any Disney film before it. If you don't like the clichéd tongue-in-cheek attitude, then perhaps the effort that has been poured into the visuals will delight. Heck, at least the mythology is far more correct than can be said about other Disney efforts (*cough*Hercules*cough*).This is a positive, 10 out of 10 review, from someone who was blown away by this film. I always suspend my disbelief with any animated film  after all, the laws of the real world are more than frequently broken in the cartoon medium. So sit back, enjoy the ride, and perhaps everyone can find something to enjoy about this film.",positive,en

"Johnnie (Bert Wheeler) is a would-be songwriter; Newton (Robert Woolsey) is a would-be inventor. Both work at a cigar stand in the lobby of an office building. Johnnie wants to sell a song to Winfield Lake, a song publisher who also owns the building. Lake's secretary, Mary (Betty Grable), is Johnnie's sweetheart. When Lake turns up dead, circumstances conspire to make Mary and Newton think that Johnnie is the killer. They conspire again to implicate Mary, who goes to jail. But who really shot Lake? Who is the Black Widow, the blackmailer who had threatened him? The other characters in this wacky murder mystery are: Lake's suspicious wife, a self-satisfied private detective, a seemingly slow-witted janitor (Willie Best), Lake's auditor, a songwriter who thinks Lake is stealing from him and another who thinks everyone is stealing from him. It's up to Newton and his truth machine to reveal the real killer.The baby-voiced Wheeler and the cigar-chomping Woolsey strike me as an arbitrary pairing, but they made several movies together in the 30s and some of them were funny.Not this one. George Stevens, who went on to have a distinguished career, directed this dismal comedy with a tedious murder mystery plot. But two scenes are good, and both feature Wheeler and Betty Grable singing the excellent ""Music in My Heart,"" written by Dorothy Fields and Jimmy McHugh. The first time, they sing it walking up a staircase (after which they dance back down). Later, Wheeler and Woolsey are on stilts so that they can see and talk to Mary, who is in a jail cell on a high floor. Wheeler and Grable sing to each other through the bars.""The Nitwits"" has a few laughs, but the level of comedy is best illustrated by Woolsey's line: ""Sonny, you've got the brain of a six-year-old boy. And I'll bet even he was glad to get rid of it."" It's watered-down Grouchowho didn't use the superfluous ""even"" when he said it.",negative,en

"Having read alot about this hotel we arrived quite worried about what exactly we would find - let me walk you through what we did find.
On arrival, the Hotel looks really nice. Its in a nice part of Lexington Avenue and could not be positioned better for sight seeing.
Check in was fast, polite and proffesional.
So far things looked good and our worries seemed unfounded.
we got into the lift and arrived at our room on the 3rd floor.
Our hearts sank when we looked upon the tatty and run down corridors. They sank even further when we got to our room to find the room opposite borded up and semi demolished.
Opening the door to our room, by now with some trepidation, we were greated with a nice sized room with two large beds which was really nice. Yes the furniture and carpet was tatty but the room was faultlessly clean and tidy.
There is a useful little kitchen, although the coffee maker come kettle was faulty in our room and blew the electrical trip. The cupboards were tatty and made of sheet metal.
The bathroom was small but perfectly adequate and beautifully clean.
Is this a nice hotel and would I recommend it - Yes I would.

You could tell that Hart was extremely determined in this movie and it showed. I also liked Lisa Dean Ryan as Mary's roommate. She was very effective in making me feel sorry for her character after she was raped. Josh Hopkins was good as the cocky and egotistical rapist. Lochlyn Munro convincingly played his character. The acting in this movie is better than in most TV movies, in my opinion.The movie was pretty predictable though. Also, I expected more from the ending, it was too abrupt.

"I saw this movie only after hearing raves about it for years. Needless to say, the actual experience proved a bit anticlimactic. But still, Alec Guiness energetically leads a wonderful cast in a jolly, if formulaic, romp through industrial post-WWII England.This is the familiar tale of the woes of inventing the perfect everyday product. Remember the car that runs on water? Remember the promise of nuclear energy? In this case, it's a fabric that doesn't wear out, wrinkle, or even get dirty! Of course, fabric manufacturers and their workers are horrified at the prospect of being put out of business, and so the plot gets a bit thick.Guiness makes the whole enterprise worthwhile, and watching him blow up a factory research lab over and over again is quite a blast! (Those Brits ... always the stiff upper lip when under fire.) The film might chug along exactly like Guiness's goofy invention, but it's a good ride all the same.",positive,en

"I will preface this review with the fact that Church Brew Works is where my boyfriend of 2 years and I had our first date so it will always hold a special significance for me, however, we have been back many times since and have enjoyed some delicious food and brews. I have enjoyed the mussels steamed with their pale ale-so good! My favorite item on their menu is the wild boar BBQ pizza (slow roasted pulled wild boar, Pious Monk Dunkel bbq sauce, red onion, corn, mozzarella and provolone cheese). I was skeptical at first having never had boar but this might be the best pizza I have eaten from a \""non-pizza centered\"" restaurant. My favorite beer is the Hefeweizen. My second is the Pale Ale. My boyfriend's father actually went to church in this building as a child (yes it used to be a church for those of you that don't already know about the history of the building) so it is especially cool for us to come here and have that connection. Even if you don't want to eat, the buidling is so unique inside you should at least stop in for a brew or two and check out this old church!",neutral,en

We had a rather inexperience member of staff looking after us who made a number of errors with wine delivery and provision of water.

"Sigh... where do I begin with this place. First off the service was appallingly bad. I mean bad like we sit down... wait... wait... drink orders ( a coffee and two waters), wait... wait... 8 minutes goes by then my coffee shows up. No water. Really? I had to flag down someone just to get some water. FALE!\n\nFood was moderate. I had the spinach pesto with chicken. It seemed like something was a bit off in how it was cooked and presented but the taste was ok. Chicken was dry but still edible. My friend got the salad and that looked much better and was much larger than I expected.\n\nThen when it came time to pay we got to play the waiting game again. I literally saw some guy at another table get equally fed up and hunt down the waiter so he could pay. Yes... it was that bad.\n\nTo sum it up: If you have places you need to be in a timely manner, avoid this place as time obviously doesn't apply to the wait staff here. Food was average but nothing to write home about. Overall I say skip this joint for food and find another place in Cesars... I know you can do better.",negative,en

"This Marriott is in a great location. It is close to every thing - great restaurants, shopping, bars, entertainment. But, it was not a great experience. We are Marriott elite members and booked this hotel 2 months in advance at a great price, When we arrived by cab, cars were backed up for a block to park, then a line of 20 people to check in! Fortunately, because we are elite members, we were able to use the special Elite desk. When we checked in with friends, were given rooms next to each other. Our room was the smallest room we have ever stayed in, including a cruise ship stateroom! Our friend's room was twice the size of ours and included a refrigerator and a sitting area. We were very upset, but the hotel was booked to capacity so we did not make a fuss. The Dance Company competition was at the hotel and it was mass chaos. Every time we took an elevator we had to wait 20 minutes. My husband could not get into the workout room and people were even lined up to use the treadmills. We wanted to have a drink at the bar, but it was packed as well and the tables in the bar area were filled with children, not adults. Although we had a great time in Chicago, it wasn't because we stayed at this Marriott.",negative,en
"Stayed for 8 nights in June 2010. I've stayed in quite a few Hilton Hotels around the world and this was by far, the worst I have ever stayed at.
Obviously, this hotel is all about the location which really is perfect in midtown a few blocks south of Central Park.
Arrived in New York from LA in the early evening and a cab from JFK cost about USD $60. You can do the public transport thing for way less but you know, so annoying with luggage. Check in was fairly easy as I had advanced purchased online. Process was easy and we were given free access to the gym with my HHonours status.
Can't remember which floor the room was on but it was fairly high up, maybe 20-something. Entire floor was tired and screaming to be renovated. This I don't usually mind so much but the room was small and not as clean as it should have been. We had trouble with the TV system during our entire stay, the remote didn't work, there was no room service menu (this was supposed to be on the tv) and repeated calls to the front desk got us nowhere. Perhaps we weren't tipping the right people... The in room wifi was also unreliable and ended up getting refunded twice as the service would just drop out and not come on again. Ended up leeching wifi from a hotel across the street which worked 10 times better than the Hilton's.
Like I said, the location is great but there really are much better hotels nearby without such a hefty price tag for very, very average service.",positive,en

My favorite is pumpkin, they should have it year round, but I've never had a bad flavor. My dream flavor though would be a tart yogurt, kind of like Pink Berry or MoJo's.

"This movie would had worked much better if this was the first Critters movie, this is a low-budget movie with only two (2) Critters shown on-screen. Why this looks like a fail is because this is the last Critters movie and it's so low-budget that it seems the director made the whole movie with his own pocket money. However, I did like this movie, I compare it mostly with the third movie (which were bad). Critters 4 have a more serious tone in it, the first half of the movie (even without seeing one Critter yet) you have a scary feeling watching it, too bad they didn't ""milk"" out the Critters, I mean even if they only had two (2) puppets they could still have used them on-screen a lot more. The Critters also have different deaths in this movie which made this a little special, especially at the end with the frozen Critter. Ug has a promotion in this part and is different in this movie which took me by surprise. Lastly I liked this one because it also has some kind of conclusion to the series, so at least we won't see a Critters 5 anymore. Oh, one last thing, I missed one scene in this movie, we never see a Critter shoot a spike from its back, maybe these puppets didn't have that feature, but I was very disappointed not seeing that (in Critters 3 we see a lot of spike shooting, which was the only good thing I liked about that movie).",positive,en

We were trying to make an 8pm movie and once the owner heard that he let us know that he put our order in front of others so we could get out on time. Very kind and thoughtful.\n\nWe tried the BLT grilled pizza as recommended by the cashier. It was okay but not great. I was a little disappointed because I thought the crust would be crispy but this was more doughy and soft than I expected. There wasn't enough bacon and the bacon that was on there was more fatty than crispy so that wasn't exactly exciting. The sauce was a ranch dressing which was very good but it almost made the bread soggy so I'm not sure that was the best route. It was basically a salad on bread..which I guess I should have seen coming. I think I would order one of the marina or pesto based pizzas next time. I will say that I loved the smoky flavor from the pizza being grilled. I definitely want to come back and try something different!\n\nI also tried the side of house-made meatballs. They were great!! They didn't come with very much marinara sauce but they had some mozzarella on top and they had very good flavor. You could tell they were very fresh. \n\nI think True has a good thing going and I will support them. They also serve a few gelato flavors, beer and wine. \n\nI wouldn't say it is the most affordable place for \""faster\"" food but they aren't too bad. \n\nGive them a shot!",negative,en

I am extremely disappointed by the service we got. I had booked an Orly-Dulles flight which got cancelled due to a gas leak. We got told that we would be on the next day flight or at worse on an extra flight they were adding on their schedule. We were then sent to a hotel and told they would contact us either later in the evening or morning. The following day with still no news from OpenSkies some of us went directly to the airport to find out what was going on. We were received very rudely by OpenSkies who actually tried their best to make us cancel our ticket. The supposed extra flight actually never existed and they were still trying to sell tickets for the DC flight of the day for EUR 6000 while we were told to wait. In the end I had to go through British Airways in the other terminal of Orly airport who called OpenSkies and told them to stop selling tickets for the NY flight and book us instead. We then got taken in charge directly by BA at Newark who got us tickets to DC in the evening. OpenSkies does not care about their customers only about turning max profit I am very disappointed especially for a BA brand.,negative,en

"Ok story but stereotypes abound
Overall I thought the book was ok but the main issue I had with the book was its lack of well developed characters overall that seemed to occur to try to make the female characters seem stronger. The writer presented the make characters negatively for the most part, best exemplified by the overly stereotyped Wyatt, while depicting all the female characters as alpha personalities lacking in little when it comes to skills or abilities. I thought Wu was given a bit more attention and not made so one dimensional as he was in the movies though, so that's something at least. I hope, if there are further stories, there is more story and less agenda.",neutral,en

"I booked this hotel because it: 1) offered shuttle service to and from the airport and Sea World, 2) I could purchase Sea World and Legoland tickets @ the office and 3) breakfast. When we arrived we found out they no longer had a shuttle driver and we were to take a taxi and the hotel would reimburse the driver. I had to pay the driver, get a receipt and then get my money from the hotel. Breakfast was NOT provided. When I went to purchase tickets for Sea World and Legoland I was told the hotel no longer carried Legoland tickets. Had I known that I would have gotten my tickets through AAA. Thankfully Mario & Monica told me about a discount on the internet for both parks and I was able to get a huge discount on the park tickets. If they had not told me to look on line I would have had to pay full price. I really appreciated their help.",neutral,en

"The best part of this hotel is the location - near Downtown Crossing and an easy walk to Fanieul Hall and the North End. This is a 3-star hotel at best.

However, once on the 6th floor, you have to walk down 3 flights of stairs to reach these facilities.

"Great, friendly, enthusiastic service. Perfect place for the adventurous type. Some of the more quirky flavors include kidney bean, sweet potato, bell pepper, and salt-and-vinegar potato chip.\n\nIf you are not so adventurous, you can stick with the sweet cream. You may also ask about the flavors in back. When I arrived, they had pumpkin spice, pistachio, and green tea on reserve. So, if the flavors up front aren't making you salivate, ask what else is hiding away elsewhere.\n\nGood coffee! Their signature chocolate hazelnut latte was just right.\n\nI like my gelato a little more dense. The gelato here is super light and airy. One good thing though: it wasn't loaded with guar, xanthum, and a ton of other emulsifiers. Just dairy, sugar and flavoring.\n\nI may only be giving this place 3 stars today, but I may change my tune in mid-August when it's 115 degrees outside.",negative,en

Don't plan on dessert unless you like flan, since that is the only dessert on the menu. The wine and cocktails were pretty good as well. \nWhat was awful was the service. Our waitress acted like serving our table was an inconvenience.

"6/8/12\n\nAll that we tried from here were simply terrific! If our next visit is just as great as our first, I'm sure I wouldn't have a problem bumping my rating up to five stars. :) So, why not give five stars outright? I'd have to say it was due to my slight disappointment in the atmosphere...\n\nWe came in and were immediately greeted by the cashier at the counter, which was situated right in front of the entrance and to the right of the pastry display cases. The coffee preparation area is behind and to the right of the cashier. All of this served to show just how busy the staff members were: the pastry chefs working in the back, who would come out to deliver fresh-baked goodies and refill the cases, the cashier taking orders at the counter, a couple of people manning the coffee area (preparing espressos, lattes, mochas, and French presses, just to name a few), and a few more going in and out of the kitchen preparing sandwiches and other items. This gave the place a bistro feel. I suppose I was expecting a little more laid-back and romantic cafe, with an in-house bakery in the back- I quickly got over it. Amelie's is a patisserie with a cafe attached to it. We sat ourselves at the set of love seat, chairs, and coffee table across from the cashier and the bakery's entrance, so for the most part of our meal, my views of the pastry cases and the rest of the cafe were blocked by lines of people ordering and paying at the cashier-- not conducive to a relaxing breakfast/brunch. I kept wishing there was a wood panel screen between our table and the traffic of people to give us some privacy. \n\nSince Mom and sis had no idea of what to order, I decided to start us out with some coffee and chocolate croissants. <url> Everyone wanted coffee, including me, but I also wanted to try AFB's mocha, so I ordered a large French press (serves 3 or 4) and a mocha latte. I expected traditional style croissants, so AFB's slightly disappointed me presentation-wise, but as long as the pastries taste delicious, I don't mind, and these croissants were terrific, and they also kept well for the next two days through our vacay in FL. Among the boxed pastries we took to go <url> I really loved the eclairs, which also kept well. I thoroughly enjoyed the bite through the outer bread layers to find the chocolate filling; It was amazingly creamy and light, yet not fluffy (I don't do fluffy), and the eclairs stayed fresh through numerous times of refrigeration and thaws. My sis enjoyed her bites of one salted caramel brownie, but interestingly enough, didn't eat the rest of it, nor touch the second one. They seemed very rich... I also enjoyed the Napoleon's crunch and buttercream-textured custard filling, but for fear of clogged arteries, I think I'll stay away from now on. :)\n\nAs for the savory selections, sister and Mom absolutely LOVED the chicken salad sandwich! <url> Mom and I really enjoyed the ham and gruyere tartine-- I loved the crunch of the toasted baguette and thought the saltiness of the cheese and ham paired well with the sweet-goodness of my mocha and croissant.\n\nYes, we've all decided to make AFB our first stop from the airport on our trips back to the Queen City!\n\np.s.

"The main attraction of this hotel is the adjoining indoor waterpark. When I was there it was filled with families who were taking advantage of the special waterpark room rates and the ""kids eat free"" deal. Unfortunately, the entire place smells of chlorine (from the pools) and damp carpet. Enormous families wander the halls in dripping bathing suits, carrying huge coolers of food and drink. Overworked housekeeping staff block the hallways with carts filled with wet towels.
Not the best experience for a solo business traveler. On the plus side, I was placed in an area on the fifth floor that appears to be reserved for people who are not on the waterpark package -- that area was quieter, and the room was fairly large. Breakfast was included, although that required navigating through the throngs of children and stressed-out parents in the restaurant.

"I really love the spacious suites at RI Hughes Center. The room rates were very reasonable - about $120/night during the week for a 1 bedroom suite with a kitchen and living room. The rooms were well cleaned each day and they had plenty of dishes, cups, ice, and utencils. \n\nRI Hughes Center offers a delicious free dinner during the slower nights of the week (Tuesdays for sure) and has a delicious complimentary breakfast each morning. I'm not talking about a Continental breakfast that teases your taste buds - I mean a real scrambled eggs, waffle, toast, bagel, cereal, sausage, etc. breakfast. \n\nThe service at RI Hughes Center is impeccable. They were there for everything I needed. My room key kept getting demagnetized because I accidentally placed it next to my cell phone and the front desk was quick to fix the key. I also had forgotten my keyboard cover and they mailed it back to me after calling to make the request.\n\nRI Hughes Center is within walking distance to the strip, but it isn't so close that you have to deal with traffic near the suites.

"That's the question you have to ask yourself when you watch this movie ""What was the point?"" This movie was nothing but an hour and a half of confusion with completely unlikable people (not going to use the word actors) and a script that you could tell didn't exist.One of the things that made me laugh the most about this movie was how it said ""Victorian story written by"" which means that there was actually a script to that part of the story. The entire victorian section had no dialogue, and was just comprised of shots of a guy staring at a girl and vice versa. Making that part of the movie as scripted as a camera left on at a train station.OK, time for the story. It starts out with a guy sitting in a chair never once getting out of it. Oh blocking, who needs you? These newspeople come to his house and practically beg him to tell this story about these dead girls. So he starts off the story in Victorian times. and here's how the scene goes (Guy and girl are in a field. pretty music starts to play) (guy stares at girl) (girl stares at guy) (guy stares at girl) cut back to movie. That's pretty much all that happens for about half the movie.The rest of the film is incredibly awkward dialogue about a bunch of models wanting to buy an apartment. So this real estate agent shows them one and when i say the dialogue is awkward i mean, if it were a dancer it would trip during the MACARENA. None of the characters in this movie are likable. The models are incredibly irritating, the victorian people don't talk, and the guy telling the story has the personality of a sack of onions. So eventually all the girls get killed off. and by killed off, i mean drug offscreen. ooh. you showed ONE death? and by death i mean holding her face till they put the blood makeup on? awesome.HOW this guy even knows this story baffles me. He says it's because he saw it. but how? there was no guy in that apartment! the door was locked shut with no way out, the windows were attached to a fire escape that was too rotten to work, how the HELL did he see all that? Oh plot holes. we DO love you. So the movie finishes up with the newswoman saying ""i think you made it up. you're wasting our time"" despite the fact that she begged him for the interview in the first place. Whatever. This movie was stupid, pointless, and made no sense with a lot of plot holes. I could go on and on about this movie, but i don't see the need. i'd much rather spend my time doing something uselful.

"Off the strip. That's its biggest downfall. The rooms were clean enough, has food options available, bingo, slots, table games, a movie theater (!), a bowling alley... and a conference center. There was a crafts fair going on when we stayed in the hotel and we were given a free ticket. It was a sad crafts fair, but should there be a convention, it's an easy and nice play to stay for the event. \nA good coupon book upon registering (one per person, so two for the two of us); which included a ticket to the showroom. Had we not had tickets to a cirque show on the strip, I would have gone (value = $5).\n\nClean, cheap, and easy. Perfect for a Vegas trip. Also has a shuttle ($8/day) to the strip should you wish to opt out of driving yourself over. One other 'hidden' cost is the $14/day resort fee. Wi-fi included in that.",negative,en

"When I heard about this place I was really excited because it is hard to find really friendly vegetarian food in Tempe. The atmosphere here is great and very sunny.

The black bean burger is good, but it comes on an untoasted piece of wheat bread that gets all soggy and falls apart. Everything else is OK, but why do they do that. It makes it disgusting.

"As I was eating this David's burger with one hand, my other hand was battling one or two of those pesky gnats floating right above the table. Those things are tough to kill unless you clap your hands on them or make a good effort to trap them against the wall of the booth. I finally nailed one of those guys near the end of the meal. \nAs for the burger, it wasn't as good as my previous visit over a year agao - nothing ever is it seems. They use frozen fries and onion rings, but claim to use fresh meat. I don't understand why you wouldn't make more of an effort with your fries/rings if you focus on burgers. David's Burger is set up like an in and Out burger right down to the thousand Island, so for about 3 bucks less you can get fresh fries and the same burger over there basically. For some reason, the Patty Melt that my date had looked good, but overall this place is a dinasaur in the burger wars in the area. And hold the Gnats next time please.",negative,en

When we arrived, not only the staff allocated us to a high floor, there was a complimentary bottle of red wine on the table for us in view of our anniversary. In the evening, you can heard a saxophonist playing just at the square, so this really add a romantic feel to the whole ambience.

"Appalling service, I ordered a phone for my son who lives in Clacton, over a 100 miles from where I live, to be collected in store by him. After placing the order I received a text saying the card used to purchase had to be presented, this was not spelt out in the terms and conditions, despite their claim it is. I telephoned the store in Clacton and was met with not just an unhelpful manager but an extremely rude manager. When I said I wanted to cancel, he said to contact customer service. I phoned customer service, the message said open seven days a week, but when you get through their automated system to the final option, it said closed, only open Monday to Friday. I phoned on Monday, got through to South Africa to a pleasant enough lady but such a strong accent, difficult to understand, she said I have to contact the store to cancel as it has already been delivered there. I phoned the store back and was met with another assistant who seemed so disinterested in anything, he said the payment won't be taken until you collect it (which we obviously can't). Now I see it has been taken off my credit card, so phoned customer service back, she said it will be refunded to the card in 14 days. I have written to complain about the absolute rudeness of the store manager at Clacton, among the things he said were that I obviously don’t read the terms and conditions like most customers, he kept interrupting me, when asked not to interrupt he said No and kept misquoting me and when I told him I was going to complain he said “you obviously have too much time on your hands” My advice, don't go anywhere near Carphone Warehouse or Currys PC World, all tarnished with the same brush",negative,en

"I have stayed at this hotel many times as an Orioles fan and on past occasions it has been more than adequate. My most recent visit was unfortunately a bit of a disappointment. The room was very nice, the bed being the high point. Marriott bedding is truly beyond compare and one of the reasons we prefer Marriott.
The room's floor, however, was filthy. I don't know whether the dark carpeting makes for less attention but though not immediately discernible to the naked eye, our socks showed proof of this after a relatively short amount of time. The bathroom was adequate, though nothing special.
It was the little things that made this particular stay question staying here in the future. It started with not being recognized (as is usually the custom) at check-in as a Silver member. I don't need to be recognized as such for my own self-worth or anything like that, but it was just an interesting indicator of the level of attention to come. I had booked this stay as a ""Romance Package"" which included champagne and breakfast for two. The champagne never materialized, and breakfast was an adventure, to say the least. For starters, it was charged to my bill (despite the package) and only through haggling with the front desk was it taken off the bill. Secondly, the breakfast experience in Cafe Promenade has definitely gone downhill. A fork presented to me was filthy and when I complained it was handled nonchalantly. The buffet food is middling at best - though on previous trips, cooked-to-order items have been very good.
I'm at a crossroads with this Marriott. I love staying there for the convenience to Camden Yards, not to mention the Marriott points, but the attention to detail was just not there like it has been in the past. It's still a serviceable place to spend the night, but the service itself needs to improve.",negative,en

"Trattoria Nakamura-Ya celebrated their two year anniversary this past week with 50% off of their two most popular dishes. The dishes on the special were their Uni Tomato Cream Pasta and their Squid Ink Spaghetti. A Japanese Italian fused restaurant... of course I called right away and booked a reservation.\n\nMy party of 2 had a reservation at 9 and when we got there our table was ready and waiting for us. The restaurant is on the small side and because of their specials every seated was filled. So I'm super happy that I made the reservation. \n\nWe started our meal with two of their appetizers\n\nA small order of their Fried Oysters - They come out really hot so be careful. The batter was nice and crispy and the oysters were perfectly cooked on the inside. Their tartar sauce really unnecessary, but it wasn't bad if you like it. \n\nTheir Balsamic Soft Shell Crab - I think they should rename it to Garlic Balsamic Soft Shell Crab because there is a very healthy portion of Garlic in this dish. To me that is a great thing because I love garlic. The crab was cook beautifully and tasted great, I only wish it was bigger, but what can you do.\n\nNow onto the main courses:\n\nSquid Ink Spaghetti - This dish was different and fun to order. The squid ink could be tasted in what I think was a white clam sauce. I thought it was a good dish, but it does have one drawback. The squid ink stains your whole mouth black while you are eating it. So be sure you are ordering with someone you are comfortable with and a first date. \n\nUnit Tomato Cream Pasta - This was so clearly the star of the meal. It was amazing! The sauce was creamy and delicious. You could clearly see the many pieces of Uni in your pasta. I would have never guess to put those flavors together, but I was amazing. It was such an amazing treat and for it to be 50% off was unbelievable. This is must try, even at its full price, if you come here\n\nHappy Anniversary Trattoria Nakamura-Ya!

"Appena rientrati dopo 12 giorni di vacanza, avevamo scelto questo Hotel tra le vaie proposte per un ottimo rapporto qualità prezzo in relazione sia alla categoria che alle recenzioni lette. La scelta è stata davvero indovinata: camere confortevoli e riposo assicurato con letti comodissimi, ottima pulizia ed elevato standard di servizi garantito dalla catena Hilton. Piscine da favola, riscaldate, con idromassaggio, scivoli e un ""fiume"" da percorrere su gommoncini che scivolano nell'acqua guidati da una lenta corrente. Un servizio tipicamente americano nel senso positivo del termine: orientato al cliente con personale molto cordiale e disponibile.
Anche i negozi dell'Hotel sono incredibilmente onesti nei prezzi che non ho trovato affatto più cari rispetto all'esterno.
""Hole in the Wall"": un ottimo ristorante per mangiare qualcosa quando non si ha voglia di uscire ma ci sono anche altre strutture sempre dell'hotel in cui si può mangiare e che non abbiamo provato.
Rispetto alle stanze standard, ci sono le suites che però sono sempre nella stessa struttura e quindi non credo valga la pena di pagare un sovrapprezzo. Molto interessanti invece le ""Casitas"", dislocate nel parco dell'Hotel con grandi terrazzi, patio e posto auto. Per quelle credo decisamente valga la pena, considerando comunque che le camere standard sono già molto comode: Ingresso/salotto con angolo caffè, TV, divano, poltrona, tavolino, cassaforte e scrivania - Bagno diviso tra WC/vasca e lavandino - Camera da letto con 2 letti matrimoniali e TV - piccolo patio esterno. Offerto in camera collegamento Internet se avete un pc con voi, altrimenti a pagamento al centro congressi.

"Yeah, not impressed. We ordered the fried zucchini to start. It's great that it's freshly hand battered, but they seem to have forgotten something -- the FLAVOR. This stuff had no seasoning on it at all, so we have to pour on a generous helping of salt to get it to taste like anything. And for $8 that's disappointing.\n\nWe each ordered burgers. At $10 a pop I was expecting a nice juicy burger. What I got was dry and totally tasteless. The whole burger just tasted like nothing. Perhaps their salt shaker fell on the floor and rolled under the fridge or something tonight. It was accompanied by some typical frozen steak fries. Again NO SALT OR SEASONING. For a $40 night out I really shouldn't have to dump salt all over everything I order. \n\nThe service...meh. Our server was so meek I could barely hear her. Serving takes a bit of personality, no? When we asked what the happy hour specials were, she said \""Ummmmmmmmmmmmmmmm....it depends on the drink.\"" What? What does that mean?

"My boyfriend and I stayed two nights at the Magic Castle. Upon meeting the staff we knew we had a winner... they were very friendly. We were delighted to find out that we were upgraded to a suite at no extra charge. The pool was gorgeous, and we were offered help with our luggage but turned it down. We got up to our room and were amazed to find an entire kitchen and more than enough space for two early 20-year olds. We felt like we really were being treated to Hollywood glamour!
The staff continued to be helpful for our whole stay. We even got a ride up to Yamashiro for dinner our second night. The free mini bar items were awesome, the breakfasts were good, and we were never bothered by any housekeepers.
The bathroom was a little dodgy, though. The only shelf was on a slant and couldn't be used, and there was mold around the tub. That wasn't enough to spoil our stay, though. And the price was definitely worth it!
Besides the beautiful pool and great staff, the best thing about this hotel is the great location. Steps away from Grauman's Chinese Theatre and Kodak Theatre.

"This hotel is very close to Los Angeles International Airport, which is why we stayed there overnight prior to an early morning coast-to-coast flight. The building has a nice, large red neon sign, making it easy enough to find. However, we couldn't find the lobby entrance for quite a while - it's in the rear, along an alley. Valet parking is mandatory, which I didn't like but was too tired to go out hunting for a parking meter late at night. The desk clerk was having a telephone conversation that lasted about ten minutes before she condescendingly checked us in. The ""bell hop"" who took our luggage upstairs also seemed to be the janitor. The halls are dark gray and foreboding. ""Twilight Zone"" best describes the hallway experience. Our room was on the 10th floor, and a sign near the elevators informed me that the ice machine was on the 9th floor. Said ice machine on the 9th floor didn't work, so I picked up a courtesy phone and was instructed to check the ice machine on the 8th floor. Finally, I got some ice. When I got back to the room, my wife told me that there was no heat in the room - and it was about 45 degrees F outside. The desk clerk sent up a space heater, but we couldn't get the room much above 60 degrees F until we stuffed a vent in the bathroom with tissue paper so the cold draft would stop filling our room with arctic air. The bathroom once had a heat lamp in the ceiling, but it had been replaced with a back-yard flood light that had been carelessly painted red. There was no coffee in the room, but expensive bottled water was available for purchase on top of an in-room refrigerator. The hotel does have a very dark and dreary restaurant that is very, very expensive. The appearance of the restaurant reminded me of a loading dock in the back of a big box department store. We did not eat there. In the morning, I called valet parking and asked them to bring my car to the front desk area. The front desk clerk was talking on the phone and never said a word to us, so I tossed our room keys on the desk and left. We waited about 15 minutes for the car before I decided to go outside and investigate. I spotted our car a short distance up the alley, but there were no keys in it. I finally got the desk clerk to get off the phone long enough to point me in the direction of the valet office at the other end of the alley. A valet got my keys but wouldn't give them to me. He obviously was seeking a tip because he asked if I had any luggage to load and if I was going to go out and come back in. I told him I would never return and demanded my keys. We drove off feeling that we had just escaped from a concentration camp. My room reservation was for $85 - but added taxes and fees (including $22 for parking my car in the alley) brought my final cost to $149. We could have stayed at a nicer hotel for a lot less money. What a disappointment!",negative,en
"We couldn't have found a place better than the 414 Inn to stay! Located in a residential neighborhood of Hell's Kitchen, it is within walking distance to nearly everything.

The staff are most helpful, are available 24 hours a day, give great directions, and have great advice for sightseeing and places to eat. The rooms are fabulous (ours was on the 4th floor), extremely comfortable, and always kept clean. My only note to travelers is that if you cannot go up and down stairs, request a first floor room when making your reservation, as the hotel does not have an elevator.
Staying at this little bed and breakfast was one of the best decisions of our entire trip and we will, most definitely, return to this hotel if we ever visit NYC again.",positive,en

"Cute but that is where it ends. \n\nI ended up at the diner because my friend and I wanted a place to get a quick bite and perhaps a glass of wine before a movie. I have driven by several times and must admit i was curious so i was anticipating finally being able to go. The place is def cute enough as well as cozy. I was there during at an in between time so there was no band to mention. The seating is quaint and i really liked the raspberry red walls. From a looks standpoint it is a 4 star in my opinion. \n\nI personally liked the menu choices. There was a lot to choose from and the some choices were somewhat unique. We got an anti-pasta plate - good; a cheese pizza paninni (or something like that) - alright; and a pear salad - not all that, it was lacking in flavor. We also ordered wine. I assume we were limited to the wine on the list we were offered so we ordered Moscatto - bad. So the star of the night was the anti-pasta. I was tasty, generous in size and had a good variety to sample from. \n\nThe main reason I gave this 2 stars was because of the waiter/bartender/whatever. He was not attentive at all. We had to get his attention for the basics: napkins, plates to eat our food on...extra napkins because he only gave us one. Never did come by to see if we were ok. I can almost say he went out of his way to not make eye contact that much so he can just do whatever it was he was doing. He seemed to be a different person at the bar from what I observed. He was interacting with the 2 couples at the bar and seemed to have a pleasant attentive attitude. But he did seem to come to life during the last 10 minutes when it was time to pick up the bill. Go figure. \n\nIn all fairness maybe I happend to go there at a bad time, who knows. I may never know because I don't see myself making plans to go out of my way to go back. If I end up there again it will be the same accidental unplanned way as it was for this visit.",negative,en

К продавцу же никаких претензий в этом нет, виновата я только сама, прочитала характеристики уж совсем очень невнимательно. Что же касается качества, то оно относительно нормальное, пошито хорошо, никаких дефектов не было (несколько торчащих ниток я не беру в расчёт). Был, конечно же, и, как обычно, неприятный запах для здешних товаров из одежды, так что, разумеется, перед ношением эту кофточку сначала нужно будет сполоснуть/постирать. И да, в описании ещё написано, что ткань из хлопка, но это синтетика, хлопка там от силы, если и есть, то максимум только 5-10%.

The rooms were relatively large and had updated linens; bathrooms pretty small (no counter space).
Location was incredibly convenient; front desk staff was less than helpful.
Housekeeping staff was very friendly and efficient; but the hotel charged $3.50 a bag to leave your luggage with bellman after check out.
Starbucks in the lobby--nice plus. Drinks in the hotel bar--way over-priced (and small to boot!).

"I have loved most of the Westin's I have stayed in & usually prefer Westin's over other hotel chains. They are usually beautiful, are respectful environmentally, have great food and allow dogs, which just makes me smile.
This Westin is dated. There are attempts at remodeling but there are still the popcorn ceilings, small bathrooms, ugly carpet, the brass/glass lobby, even a polyester-type comforter for the top layer of bedding with a cotton comforter cover over it. It's just not like the down filled comforter covers at the other hotels.
It has a good location in downtown Seattle and great views with a big floor to ceiling windows of Puget Sound.
The worst part of all was the food. I ordered at the lobby restaurant and the food was so unoriginal, bland, unappetizing that I sent 2 things back (which I never do). Thinking that their food sounds like some of the other original plates at the other hotels, I ordered the goat cheese/mushroom pizza. It was the boring pizza you get from a delivery service and it was topped with bleu cheese not goat. Ordered a berry parfait for breakfast and it came in a bowl (not a fountain glass) full of mushy granola mixed with milk-like yogurt, basically like cereal with milk that had been sitting out for a while. I ordered salmon in one evening and it was so chewy. It was served on top of some sweet potato/spinach combo that looked like something in the frozen food section. Not anything like the side of fresh sweet potatoes and spinach that I imagined.
Not a great experience",neutral,en

"I had a frustrating experience with Alaska. I got a round trip from San Jose to San Diego with my family and among the free items you can check-in are strollers and car seats. On the first flight we were able to check-in for free our son's car seat and wagon-stroller for free. We even called ahead days in advance to ensure we could take our wagon-stroller with us for free. However on the return flight we had to pay to document and check-in the wagon-stroller. The handling of situation was terrible from Alaska. They argued that wagons are not strollers but failed to show any Alaska documentation of their definition of a strollers as ours has seat belts for the kids and can fold to fit the size of large stroller but has a wagon shape. The personnel argued that double strollers were fine but ours was not (even though our could be smaller). We showed them the model on the internet (which states it is a stroller wagon) and even when you search on google for strollers images of this type show on top along the traditional strollers. They argued that allowing us to check-in our ""wagon"" for free during our first flight was a mistake. To make matters even worse, the personnel argued that we use the stroller to carry our stuff which is besides the point as you can do that why any stroller. This suggested to me that Alaska didn't care whether this was a stroller or not and made it harder to actually get an understanding of the rules rooted on Alaska's policies, which Alaska was not able to provide. Along this lines (about not really being helpful) and taking their attitude to a different level, one of the personnel we were having the conversation in order to try to ""solve"" the problem threatened us by saying ""do you want to fly today?"". Not sure what this person was thinking but that only make this experience worse. In the end a more cool headed personnel came in, acknowledged our frustrations and provided a number we can use to complain. This frustrating and unpleasant experience was a result of the poorly documented, inconsistent policies and communication channels at Alaska, and exacerbated by the even worse customer service from Alaska employees at the San Diego airport. I will avoid using Alaska in the future as it is not worth the stress.",negative,en
"I was originally supposed to stay at the Fitzpatrick Hotel in NYC. After looking at the reviews on this website I came across a review that said that a reviewer had stayed at the Fitzpatrick and encounter Cockroaches. As I am extremely grossed out by these vile insects I cancelled at the Fitzpatrick and decided to stay at Morgans in NYC.
The cost was higher but the staff was great. They were accommodating and friendly. We thought the location was great and we liked the room. I evern liked to iron that was in the room for ironing my clothes. I read in other reviews that the lighting in the living room space of the suites was a problem for some. However, I was not bothered by the lighting. Although it would be a good idea just to add an addition lamp with a high wattage bulb. Anyway, on my last night there my husband and I decide to make it an earlier night and headed up to the penthouse for drinks. This was also something that we liked about the hotel. As we sat out on the balcony I saw a nasty disgusting and very large cockroach. I hurried moved away in asked for the check. I told the server/bartender and her only response was that she had noticed how quickly we moved inside and that she also disliked them. The next morning when checking out of the hotel I got the obligatory how was your stay and I made mention of the incident. The clerk at the desk apologized and said how Cockroaches are often seen around NYC. As if there was nothing that could be done about the situation. Now I lived in NYC for 5 years and the apartment that I lived in had the building serviced by an exterminator twice per month and I never saw one of those vile insects in my apartment.
What is very concerning is there seemed to be an attitude of this is NYC - get used to it. There wasn’t even an offer to Comp the drinks we where having when I saw the roach. Nice hotel but I would not stay again. I would gladly pay more to stay at a hotel that doesn’t think it just a part of the NYC experience to have Roaches crawling around the property.",negative,en

"Very good Persian food. The food alone gives the place 4 stars.\n\nA couple of items that could take this place to 5 stars:\n\n- The routing. The kitchen is right next to the front desk, where we saw anywhere from 4 to 12 people waiting to be seated. Lots of bumping, jostling, and getting out of the way of servers with huge plates of food. It might take longer, but I think management should train the servers to take an immediate left and only go through the dining area.\n\n- The furniture is a little worn.\n\n- The carpet needs some regular and frequent sweeping. We saw more than a little food on the ground.\n\n- Attentiveness. I'm not sure if it was the restaurant.com coupon or the fact that we weren't drinking, but I'd like someone to come around more often than every 30 minutes.\n\nThe food was truly terrific though.

We were also impressed with the breakfast, which was the standard for this chain, but stood out from any of the other Hampton Inns we have used because it was so clean and well supplied. The manager was going from table to table asking if all was okay and then the lady who was taking care of the breakfast area, came and took away our plates etc for us. The location is wonderful, right near the Space Needle and close to transit. We are walkers, so we found it convenient to even walk down to the waterfront and Pikes Market.

"Ok so we checked into the hotel late late at night. We were so tired and we explained that to the guy who was checking us in... but still he insisted on selling tickets to these tour buses. So after about 30 min we got to go to our room. IT WAS BLAZING HOT! So we went back down stairs and explained to the man how hot it was. It turns out that in the winter time they take out the air conditioners! He gave us keys to 3 other rooms for us to check out and see if they were a little bit cooler. NOPE! they were all steaming hot. So we went back to our room and opened the window and stuck it out. The lobby is very nice but once you walk into the elevator (which is very very slow) or go up the steps (which are so narrow that you cannot pass someone going the other sirection or someone will have to back up) the scenery changes. All 4 of the rooms that we saw were smaller than rooms on a cruise ship. They were clean but the house keeping has left an envelope that you are suppossed to leave money in everyday. Maybe its just us but I would rather leave the money after the job is done than before, but maybe thats just a southern thing. We decided just to keep our room clean ourselves and put up the do not disturb sign up when we left. I felt more comfortable doing that since we had money, laptops , cameras etc etc in the room. (there are no safes or lockboxes) When you leave the room you are required to leave your key. We did this most of the time and had no problem getting it back as we walked back through the door. The staff was far from friendly. No one ever greeted us or thanked us for our stay. DONT fall for the comedy club ticket scam. ""stand up ny"" ""dangerfields"" and "" HA'S"" were all horrible. As well as dirty. Not to mention ""stand up ny's"" manager was so rude that we left. Dont fall for the bus tours eaither. Everything is within walking distance pretty much and you can always take the subways. The cafe 2 doors down (cranberry) was excellent and so was O'Luneys Pub (about 4 doors down) Oh and ESPN Zone was very reasonably priced and delicious. Unfortunately we had to leave early because of a family death when we called to get our wake up call for 3am, the staff was rude and complained about it being so early. I dont see why it mattered they were awake anyways. But over all it was ok. The price was good and you get what you pay for i guess.",positive,en

"I've been waiting to review the Genghis Grill because I really don't know what to say.\n\nThe concept is a solid one - I was a fan of BD's when they were here, but that could be because the cooks were so awesome. Plus, you could go back again and again.\n\nAt Genghis Grill, however, it reminds me more of a cafeteria than the open and fun atmosphere that hasn't been around here since BD's left. Can you tell that I miss BD's?\n\nSo you go through the line and start piling things on. If you screw up, you're stuck. Unless you go for the \""endless bowl\"" (or whatever the call it), for a slight upcharge. To make matters a bit worse, the smallish bowl they give you for your plate is a bit on the tiny size, so don't screw up.\n\nHere, the endless option is probably better - because you have a pretty good option of screwing up the flavors.

"Un samedi pluvieux à Paris et me voici devant ce film totalement au hasard sans en avoir jamais entendu parler. Malheureusement le hasard n'a pas bien fait les choses. Casanegra est un film sympathique dont le réalisateur, c'est son deuxième, a voulu plaire autant aux critiques, aux spectateurs et aux acheteurs étrangers. Le résultat est un film assez brouillon, avec de belles choses (notamment visuelles), une ville, Casablanca, parfaitement filmée et semblant être un personnage à part entière. Autrement la mise en scène est un peu trop bancale, tantôt lente et ennuyeuse, tantôt speed et rythmée et les accélérations de l'image donnent mal au cœur. Le scénario est tout aussi bancal, on ne croit pas vraiment aux personnages et à ce qu'il se passe. Quelques beaux moments, mais vraiment trop rares. Les acteurs ne sont pas au top bien que le duo de copains fonctionne bien dans leurs différences et leurs rêves tout aussi différents. Mais ça finit vite par tourner en rond et à nous désintéresser. Dommage le début était prometteur. Sorti dans peu de salles, cela ne devrait pas faire longtemps à l'affiche.

"Pros:
- close to LAX, 10 minute shuttle ride
- good free breakfast
- large room
Cons:
- rooms have ""old hotel"" smell
- not many food options nearby
- small gym
Overall, it's your average airport hotel. The best feature of the hotel is the breakfast. Like all of the other Embassy Suites I've stayed at, they have a nice breakfast buffet with a cooked-to-order omelet station. The room was spacious, but definitely needed a make-over, as it had an odor, possibly from prior years when smoking was allowed. The gym was also very small and basic. I would choose this property over the Embassy Suites LAX South, as this one is cleaner and less noisy.",positive,en
"I didn't choose this hotel, but \""won\"" it on the Priceline lottery. I have had good luck in the past when using Priceline, but after finding out what hotel accepted or price and reading the reviews on here, I wasn't too excited.\nWhen we pulled up to the hotel the first time, it looked nice and the lobby isn't over the top, but also nicely kept and decorated. They did have our reservation wrong - they had us with a king sized bed and in a smoking room. We wanted non-smoking and 2 beds. The registrar changed it without a problem. \nWe got to our room and literally the first thing we saw when we walked in the room was a dead cockroach on the floor. Granted, it was dead, but it was big and that just lead me to believe there would be more. Thankfully, there weren't. There was also a very stale and musty odor in the room - it was pretty clear no one had stayed in this room for a long time. After we opened it up a bit, the smell dissipated. \nThe room was pretty plain and typical, but to rate this as a 3 1/2 star hotel, I would have expected at least a flat screen tv. Also, the beds were horrible! The mattresses were hard and clearly old. They were both bowed in the middle. I sleep on my side and I woke up each morning with a sore shoulder. One thing I will say about this hotel was that it was QUIET! I always worry about noise when we have our kids with us, but I didn't hear a sound. There was a wedding one of the nights we stayed there and even then, I didn't hear anything. However, I think that had more to do with the fact that there was no one actually staying there! It was over a holiday weekend and the parking lot was practically empty. Granted, it was 100 degrees and we are probably the only people that left San Diego to go to Phoenix that weekend, but it ended up working to our advantage. The pool was well maintained and again, we were literally the only ones in it. The only pool complaint I have was from the last day of our stay. They were trimming the palm trees in the pool area and there was palm stuff all over - including in the pool. My husband was stung by a wasp that I assume were disturbed by all the trimming.\nOverall, it wasn't bad, but a little pricey for what it actually is. I would have gladly paid around $90/night for this place instead of the $120 that I actually did. And when we got our bill, there was an $8/night resort fee. This isn't a resort - it's a hotel. There isn't anything special about the San Marcos and I probably won't stay here again, but if you land here like I did, it's tolerable.",negative,en

"This was my first time seeing or staying at this hotel. I have to say I was pretty shocked upon pulling up in the parking lot...the hotel could best be called orange. WOW. I was a little nervous about what the inside would be like, but was pleasantly surprised. It had typical decor, amenities and rooms.
I stay at Red Lion hotels pretty often and have found there to be a range of what they offer. I would say this one falls right in the middle. There were no glaring flaws (carpets were clean, room was average size, decor was farily modern) or amazing features (parking was outside, view was parking lot).
We didn't eat at the restaurant which was in the parking lot, outside the hotel, so I can't weigh in on that. There was very little plane noise throughout the night, but I could hear some in the morning. But considering that this hotel is literally across the street from the airport, so that's to be expected. I was a little disapointed that I was charged $10 for outdoor, self parking. Perhaps this is an airport hotel standard.
All in all, it was about what I would expect from an airport hotel...close, convenient, and reasonably priced.",positive,en

"I had high hopes for this place due to the beautiful surroundings and great reviews, but our experience was below average. This is definitely a busy spot so we made a reservation for 6. When we got there, we were told that they didn't have a table available for our party, so we could cram into a table for 4 or wait. We just took the small table. It took around 10-15 minutes for a server to approach us, though she was quite nice. We placed our order and waited for quite a while.\n\nThe food was just OK. It was nice and fresh, but lacking much taste or creativity. The eggs, potatoes, and sausage were cooked without any seasoning. Take some fresh local ingredients and dump them on a flattop until cooked.... OK, they won't taste too bad because they're fresh, but they won't taste great either. I ordered the Cowboy Breakfast--two eggs over easy with chili. Very, very bland, and the beans were not cooked enough. I had to dump a sea of hot sauce on my plate to even taste anything.\n\nThey are also a bit tricky with their drinks. When they seat you, they will tell you to help yourself to a drink station that features lemonade, iced tea, and and coffee in huge decanters. They don't explicitly say you are being charged for these drinks, but when the check comes, you'll discover that the server has tallied up every cup at your table and charged you $3.50 each. A bit underhanded, if you ask me.",negative,en

"OK - you want to test somebody on how comfortable they are with their adolescence and the embarrassing and maniacal changes therin - then get their immediate reaction from watching this uproarious doc about kids making socially relevant horror flicks in the suburban 80's. More than any movie I has ever seen, the film deals with burdening sexuality and ego in a way that is completely human, never dull, and flushed in the kind of inherent goodness of youth that is discolored by the fear-frenzied adult world where any quirk in youth is accredited to anything from insanity to perversion. Mini-mogul Darren Stien seems to be reaching for a deeper understanding of his triumphs and misgivings as the patriarch of strict kid's world. What he finds in himself and others isn't always pretty - but shows how one can improve and reconcile with age. What does change mean without reflection. I love this movie.",positive,en

"I have stayed at this hotel 3 times in the last year, most recently last night. I have also stayed at the Lofts across the driveway and will be returning soon. This hotel has gone thru a wonderful renovation but needs to work on training their staff. Check in and valet was smooth and swift even when they were the busiest. My room was nice but I did not have a breakfast card in my room so I did not stay for breakfast this morning as I normally would have. I had placed a 8:30 wake up call, but at approx. 8:16 this morning housekeeping started knocking on my door and surrounding doors wanting to know if I was checking out. I have worked in the hotel business before and this was inappropriate and not a pleasent way to wake up. From my experience housekeeping can start their day with a list of rooms that guests have checked out of then later in the morning seek rooms that have not yet vacated. I stopped by the desk on my way out and the woman at the desk did not appologize, she simply stated that housekeeping started at 8am. I will return but hope they renovate the front line staff to match their new hotel.",negative,en

"DID NOT STAY! I had booked a reservation in June through a special deal at travel ticker. The price was excellent under $215 per night for a stay in October of this year which is the middle of high season in the city. The price since then has been averaging about $269 per night. I stayed with a friend for a few days in June because her roommate was traveling and went there in person to check it out. If I had not I probably would have stayed and been upset.
You would think it was fine from the street view and because it was a Radisson and on Lexington Avenue but I was disappointed almost immediately when I walked in. The condition of the lobby was old and worn looking. I was still trying to keep an open mind and proceeded to the front desk and told them I had a reservation in October but was concerned because of some bad reviews and asked to see a room . I waited for over a half an hour for someone to come out and show me and nobody came out until I asked what was taking so long despite the fact I told them I posted regular reviews on Trip Advisor. I think they were hoping I would leave. I watched the front desk and while there were lots of people checking in I was not impressed with the attention paid to patrons at the front desk by the staff.
When someone did come out she was very pleasant and we took the elevator to a room. The condition of the hallways and the carpeting on the way to the room was disgusting and filthy. The room much to my surprise was very small but lovely. It was a standard queen. It turned out I was told the room I booked was even smaller, a petite room. Now I have stayed in small rooms in NYC before but this was already pretty small. I was told all the rooms were in similar condition but the overall condition of the hotel was dilapidated and not for me. I canceled my reservation.The only good thing I can say about my experience and the hotel is that it is in a great location.",negative,en

"Unfortunately this is the worst BJ's location I've ever been to, and I love BJ's food normally. The deep dish pizza was just not that good, and I normally think their deep dish pizza is a model of perfection. The crust wasn't really 'deep' and more like regular pizza crust. The toppings were pitiful - barely any sauce, practically no cheese, and very little of the toppings that were supposed to come with the pizza. I was so disappointed. The service is great but that doesn't really matter to me when the food they are bringing me is sub par. They have all day happy hour when games are on and the bar has a decent number of TV's with NFL Sunday Ticket but the food was too disapointing for me to go back.",negative,en

"My husband and I stayed here for one night on March 31, and checked out Sunday, April 1. The entire lobby was closed and relocated to one of the ball rooms inside the hotel (prior reviewers thought the renovations may have been completed but as of this past Sunday, they are still going strong). It was inconvenient to heft the luggage up the fire stairs into the hall/ballroom area, but attendants were readily available to lend a hand. Despite the makeshift concierge and check-in desk, everything went smoothly, we were given a complimentary upgrade, and as Best Western members we received a certificate for 10% off our lunch or dinner at their Cafe Pescatore downstairs. The room was one of the best sizes we've encountered in San Francisco (this being our second trip, third hotel in the city) and it was very clean. We asked for a courtyard view room so it would be quieter, but I imagine once you get above the second floor, the view from the street-facing rooms would be very nice. It is a very convenient location to Fisherman's Wharf and restaurants, also. If you plan to stay there any time soon, be advised renovations will be going on. However, if you're using it for one night, or don't plan to be using the lobby a great deal, it suits just fine, especially for the price!!",neutral,en

The rooms were large and spacious, and aside from a few rowdy kids in a neighboring suite, extremely quiet (though my windows faced into the courtyard).

"They do kind of hassle you a bit if you have a Groupon or some kind of deal so I'd say just go and do the happy hour. Its not that bad of a deal.\n\nThe chips and salsa you get is pretty fantastic. The chips are thicker than typical - almost like pita chips. Salsa is a pureed chipotle type, not a pico de gallo type. The taste is pretty good and the chips aren't terribly greasy. \n\nWe got the barbacao taco plate, the queso dip and the sweet potato fries. The barbacao tacos weren't great.. We're huge fans of this dish at fuego bistro but they taste a lot better as a short rib with cornbread than as a taco. The rice and beans that come on the platter are very good. I would try a different taco. \n\nThe queso dip was unusually bland. The consistency was very rich and thick but somehow it doesn't taste very good. We ended up mixing in the salsa and it improved the taste quite a bit. You also seem to get way less chips than you would think you'd need for about a cup and a half of queso..\n\nThe sweet potato fries were awesome! The batter is pretty light and with the right amount of salt. Some of the fries were limp and some were crunchy, but all in all a very good menu item and a steal at $3. The chipotle ranch sauce that comes with is pretty fabulous as well. \n\nAll in all, the location kind of sucks. Its always more hassle than I like when you have to valet or validate - no matter how painless it is. Especially now with the theater being a dinner serving type, its hard to find yourself there just to eat. But if you're there, this place is pretty good!",neutral,en

"Our flight was at 2.25am, and for some reason a full meal (fried fish) was on offer after take off, when we were expecting a light snack. On our flight outbound to Singapore the flight attendants regularly walked up and down with drinks of water. On this flight that did not happen. I had to ask for water because I was developing a migraine because I was dehydrated. Our row seemed to miss out on service a couple of times, with no top ups of tea and coffee. The breakfast was poor and lukewarm. One of the toilets was marked out of order in our aisle, and when I went to the toilet opposite there was no toilet paper or hand towels. This was rectified when I complained. When I went to the toilet again there was quite a queue and I asked an attendant if I could use the toilet at the front of the plane, and was told that it was for first class customers only, which I found annoying because economy passengers should have access to working toilets and it seemed unreasonable not to allow the use of toilets at the front of the plane in view of toilets being out of order in the middle, and appeared to be unavailable on one side at the back of the plane as well. Our seats were close to the toilets and they were smelly. I was very unimpressed with an airline which is reputedly one of the best in the world. Not impressed.",negative,en

"S.S. Van Dine must have been a shrewd businessman in dealing with Hollywood. Most of the film series' from the studio days were usually confined to one or two studios. But apparently Van Dine must have sold his rights to each book about Philo Vance one at a time. Note that Paramount, MGM, Warner Brothers, and more all released Philo Vance films. Only Tarzan seemed to get around Hollywood more.MGM produced the Garden Murder Case and starred Edmund Lowe as the fashionable detective. Of course MGM had the screen's original Philo under contract at the time, but Bill Powell was busy doing The Thin Man at the time and I guess Louis B. Mayer decided to concentrate him there.Edmund Lowe is a pretty acceptable Philo Vance. Lowe had started out pretty big at the tail end of the silent era with What Price Glory and then with a string of films with Victor McLaglen with their Flagg and Quirt characters. But after McLaglen got his Oscar for The Informer, Lowe seemed to fade into the B picture market. The Garden Murder Case involves three separate victims, Douglas Walton, Gene Lockhart, and Frieda Inescourt. The sinister atmosphere around the perpetrator kind of gives it away, the mystery is really how all the killings are connected and how they are accomplished.I will say this though. Vance takes a very big chance in exposing the villain and the last 15 minutes are worthy of Hitchcock.",positive,en

"Spoilers. This review has been edited due to word limit.`The horror. The horror.' Marlon Brando, Apocalypse Now (1979) and Apocalypse Now Redux (2001)The sentence which is as famous as `Here's looking at you, kid,' or `Are you talkin' to me?' or `May the Force be with you,' or `I'll be back,' means a little more than some one-liners. When it is spoken it lingers in the air with an importance and meaning that does not go unnoticed. What might drive some viewers nuts is that they may never find an answer to the horror unless they re-watch the film and try to pay close observation to every single frame.What, exactly, does this line of dialogue mean? The horror spoken of is the reality of war. The reality of moral men being so easily corrupted that they turn on their inborn instincts and kill fellow beings without any sign of guilt. When Capt. Willard (Martin Sheen) stands before the dying Col. Kurtz (Marlon Brando) at the end of the film, `The horror.the horror.' is the realization of Willard's corruptness. He has mercilessly killed a man in cold blood as part of his assignment. This isn't a typical Hollywood ending. In most cases a character gains something, whether it be emotionally, physically, mentally or all three. But Willard both gains and loses. He gains the knowledge that he has lost his morals. And that is a shocking ending.`Apocalypse Now' is Francis Ford Coppola's tribute to the artistic side of filmmaking. This film is wholly different from `The Godfather.' It is hallucinogenic, visually dazzling, and an ode to the guilty side of human nature. At first it seems realistic, and then it becomes strange, and then symbolic, and, by the end, original in its own unique perspective of the spiritual side of warfare. This is not as much a film about the Vietnam War as it is a film about the war within us.At first it does appear to be another war film. Captain Willard (Sheen) is assigned by an Army Lieutenant (a young Harrison Ford) to assassinate a renegade American Colonel named Kurtz (Brando), who is hiding out somewhere in Vietnam with a hoard of troops who more or less act as his slaves.Willard carries out his mission `with extreme prejudice,' heading out on a boat along with four soldiers, including the boat captain, Chief (Albert Hall), Chef (Frederic Forest), and a very young `Larry' Fishburne (who later went on to appear as Morpheus in `The Matrix').""Apocalypse Now"" is in a many ways a modern update of Homer's Odyssey. As our main character, Willard, carries on his journey, he meets an array of original and strange characters, including Lt. Col. Kilgore (Robert Duvall), who has a strange fetish for surfing, and a stoned photographer (Dennis Hopper), whose lively gestures and mannerisms can be compared to those of the very much lesser Jeremy Davies in ""The Million Dollar Hotel,"" one of the worst films I have ever seen. Davies failed to make any connection with an audience; Hopper does. He is like the poetic vibe between Willard and Kurtz; he is like an interpreter going back and forth and speaking in foreign languages. In this case, he is translating Kurtz to Willard, although I'm not so sure Kurtz needs a translation of Willard.Many films are lucky enough to have one or two memorable scenes or lines. ""Apocalypse Now"" has many. Kilgore descending upon a Vietnam village playing Wagner's ""Ride of the Valkyries"" remains one of the most remembered scenes in all of film history. There is sharpness to it, a brutality to it, an ironic tone to it, and also a sense of playfulness. When Kilgore kneels down on that beach and says, `I love the smell of napalm in the morning.it smells like victory,' we all crack a smile.I won't lie to you: `Apocalypse Now' is a strange film. It isn't exactly the easiest thing to analyze. The end may frustrate some viewers if they don't understand Marlon Brando's significant speeches. But what it all comes down to, what really matters, is that this film is about the dark nature of the human psyche. The horror is the realization of war and its effects, not the war itself. Kurtz says, `You have a right to kill me. But you have no right to judge me.' Brando's character, Kurtz, is left to the audience to judge. To many naïve viewers he may appear as a crazy loon whose power got to his head. But that isn't what Francis Ford Coppola is trying to get across. By fighting in Vietnam, Kurtz has realized just how great he had it, and how bad some others had it. By walking through devastated villages he eventually comes to realize that we are the naïve ones, living our lives in a fool's paradise. We are totally naïve to our surroundings and possible misfortunes until they hit. By seeing how unlucky some Vietnamese are, Kurtz realizes just how easily he could be struck by something. Just how easily he could end up like the people around him. And he also realizes that the people who did this are people who have abandoned their morals and left them at the door. Many people think the horror is one thing. It is two. For Kurtz, the horror is the reality of how naïve he was and the reality of the war's impact upon men. And after Willard murders Kurtz, and hears Kurtz's dying words, he realizes it too. He realizes the effects of war. To see so many soldiers with no sense of right or wrong makes him realize the horror of what war can do to a man. And what it has done to him. The horror.5/5 stars -",positive,en

"It's taken me this long to write a review because I tried to forget.
The room I'd reserved had been given away. I'd stopped for groceries, having reserved a room with a kitchenette. The manager, whose name I knew from my phone call, claimed in person I'd not reserved this type of room. I'd spoken to him two days prior, and had the reservation printout. He denied everything, including what was in black and white.
He said that instead, I should use the microwave in ""the breakfast room"" during limited hours. They'd described it as a nice, relaxed dining room. It was a tiny, fluorescent lit square. Like eating in a public restroom.
A nice clerk quietly told me my room had indeed, been given away. The room they tried to give me stunk of vomit and harsh disinfectant. There was no bathtub. The new, flesh-coloured paint was applied sloppily over decades of old paint. Though I arrived an hour past check in, they were doing repairs in the room. The repairman yelled at me for coming in.
They had claimed on both their website and on the phone, that they had renovated and were offering a ""limited time"" low price. I have luck with sales, so I went for it. The renovations were minimal. The basic dinginess was still there, just covered with new but extremely cheap furnishings. E.g. the lobby smelled of sweat and fried food, but they'd put out searingly bright plastic flowers and a rug.
As I was at the desk trying to get my credit card reimbursed, the repairman stomped past with his ladder and glared at me. I still don't know why. The one desk clerk was a very nice young man.

"The Bellagio is home to some of the best, most elegant restaurants in Las Vegas. Several months ago, I dined at the buffet--truly the best buffet I have ever experienced. This time, I decided to try Jasmine, a much touted and pricey Chinese restaurant. Now, as most of you know, Chinese food--even delicious Chinese food--is typically quite inexpensive. That's why I was curious to see if there was anything different or tres gourmet about Jasmine to justify it's acclaim AND its price tag. To my disappointment, I found little justification.

"This place is very good!\n\nI stumbled across this place when driving down Hayden today and decided to drop in and give it a try. There were a lot of really nice sounding options on the menu ranging from Burgers to hot dogs to burritos with lots of tasty sounding toppings on each.\n\nI opted for the Arizona burger and the Sonoran Hot dog. The Arizona burger had a homemade green chili beef in it which was VERY good and the Sonoran Dog was surprisingly really good. I say surprisingly because I am used to El Guero Canelo down in Tucson which has the best Sonoran dogs and did not think I would come away satisfied because of going to that place in Tucson a lot. The Sonoran dog here measured up well and was very tasty.\n\nWhile i was waiting Vanessa the owner came up to my table and introduced herself and told me about the place. She was very nice and accomadating and made me feel welcome. You could tell her and her husband take a lot of pride in their restaurant. Everything was really nice and clean and the staff was also very helpful.\n\nI will definitely go back to this place, Great spot. And great food!",positive,en

"If I had given this Sheraton a grade on the first night of my visit it would have been 4-stars. The room was nicer than what I expected for a 3-star property and exceeded many of the reviews posted earlier (spacious, clean, etc.). The location was also convenient and the service was accommodating (i.e. – check in and Concierge). I had previously stayed at the Embassy Suites that is a block away (rated higher on Tripadvisor) and thought I had got a real bargain at the Sheraton (the Sheraton was $100 less a night). However the housekeeping staff made me rethink my rating on the second day/night of my stay. Though I was gone from my room for about 7 hours (10:00 AM – 5:00 PM) they failed to clean my room. Wanting to take a nap upon my return, I did not complain to the front desk (and have the room cleaning interfere with my plans). That plan did not turn out to work to perfection because I spent my “rest time” listening to the staff whoop it up in the hall.
In all this is a solid 3-star hotel that if they really cared, could raise the bar to 4-stars.",negative,en

"As much as 'The Beginning' showed that we're still going to get ""classic"" x-files, Drive showed that the X-Files was going to explore new territory. They start by giving us a unique teaser to Drive, with the news camera footage. It was an interesting transition from the the TV to the real events. I would've liked it even better if they had kept that news footage camera for the entire teaser and not cut to the inside of the car. Upon viewing this episode live back in 1998 I was thinking, ""Am I on the right channel?"" That first autopsy by Scully flooded me with big words that I don't understand. I think she learned her lesson to ALWAYS wear a mask before performing an autopsy. Silly Scully! What is the deal with the lighting in the autopsy lab? It's as dark as a tomb in there! How are they supposed to see what they're doing in there? Assistant Director Kersh gets his first lines in this episode. I have no love lost for that man. He is the third recurring character in a row that is introduced that you love to hate, the first two being Diana Fowley and Jeffrey Spender. I guess the producers felt that there was too much love going on for Mulder, Scully and Skinner. So they needed to add some characters to give our favorite agents some grief and incite our ire as fans. I love the quarantine suits worn by Scully and her team with the cool helmet light bulbs. Boy. It's really smoky or foggy in DRY northern Nevada at night. Can we say the word ""effect""? Drive is a cool episode, but looking at route 36 on my U.S. atlas, there's no way Mulder could've maintained a speed of 70-100 MPH on that road. If he had been on I-80, the freeway, maybe. But no way on a state road with that many curves. All of the filming inside the car looked very authentic. Excellent job by Rob Bowman. It looks nothing like the old days of the obvious blue screen or clip of passing scenery outside a car window on a stage. This was a fun episode, but some of the inaccuracies keep it from being a great episode. It keeps you on the edge of your seat, so hold on for a fast ride!",positive,en

"Stayed at the Sheraton for a convention for 5 nights. Room was clean and comfortable yet small. Being charged $16 per night to park I thought was excessive since everything else in the hotel was so expensive. $12.99 for a standard breakfast buffet that was little more than Hampton Inn or Fairfield Inn. No internet in your room unless you want to pay $10 per day but it's free in the lobby. View from the room was Interstate 35. Staff was fairly friendly unless they were busy and told you they didn't serve off of the carpet in the lounge area. Drink prices I felt were excessive, $8 for a Bloody Mary in a small glass was a little more than I could take and then when my wife found the long dark hair in it,YUCK!!!!! Over all this hotel is fairly comfortable but I expected more from a Starwood property. Would not recommend this hotel to friends.",negative,en

The breakfast is wonderful! Every day you can choose fresh fruits, bakery, fresh orange juice. The best is the big Esprosso machine, where you can make a superb coffee (Lavazza coffee). The machine is on the whole day, so you can take a cup of coffee (or more ;-) whenever you want.

"We are a tough crowd, being homesick New Orleanians. So with that in mind, we sometimes need at least a reminder of a few dishes we've been unable to make here. We've visited now 3 times, and each time we had a friendly waiter and they had Abita, and even once, Dixie in a bottle, which sent my husband over the moon (beer, for the uninitiated). Their Bloody Mary's were also pretty good. I have ordered oysters twice, once was great, the other had to be sent back b/c they were underfried. Their french bread, which they get from a local bakery, is spot on. The way it should be. Crunchy and light, not doughy and sweet. If you go, be sure to order a po-boy. It's pretty authentic. However, I would stay away from \""etoufee\"" or anything that when not in New Orleans takes a decidedly tourist take on the dish. We took our children for Mardi Gras dinner, and they enjoyed it, even if the waiters had no idea why our children wanted to throw beads at them. \n\nThe atmosphere was comfortable and very New Orleans, and they had coffee with chicory, difficult to find even in the best of circumstances outside the city limits of NOLA. So please, do yourself a favor and get fully caffinated before you leave. Even if it's after dinner. It's no ordinary coffee. You'll be pleased with your pep. I give three stars -- one missing for oddly cooked food on occasion and lack of attention to detail on some dishes; one simply because I know I'm not at home when I eat here.",negative,en
"I'm not sure how to rate this place. We tried on several occassions to go but they never seem to be open or they weren't serving food so we started calling first and we caught them open and serving food! So we rushed over as we only live a few miles away. The place is much nicer than the old Cactus Club but it is still very small. It has about 6 tables at the most and 7 or 8 bar stools. The cook was grilling out back and it smell wonderful! THe tables were all full except one...perfect. \n We ordered 1 Budwiser ( we are not beer drinkers) 1 wine and 1 water. We got them about 10 minutes later. We ordered 1 pulled pork special, 1 green chili burger and 1 peppercorn burger. It's been 25 minutes, drinks are gone and we are still sitting without food. If the waitered hadn't been so funny I would have been upset. He was the bright side to the wait. Finally we got the food about 35 minutes later. The waiter was very apologetic. THe menu says everything is from local growers and ranchers so maybe they had to go round it up. All the burgers are 12 dollars and the pulled pork was 12 dollars, you get either a spring mix salad or bleu cheese potato salad. There are no condiments on the table, no salt or pepper. The pulled pork was wonderful! But it said it came with a wonderful sounding cole slaw that I never got. That's ok it was great without it. Nice bark yet tender and not something that sat in a crock pot all day. Left a wonderful smoky after taste. Best I've ever had. My son liked the Green Chili burger, my husband said there was nothing that made the peppercorn burger worth 12 bucks and he said he didn't taste any peppercorns at all. So 3 sandwiches 2 drinks (domestic beer Moscato wine) 52 dollars. \nOk ...so they need to get it together and be open when they say they are. They need to be able to cook and serve more than 1 table at a time. (their grill is the size of one you might find in a back yard.) If they are gonna charge those prices for a burger it better be a damn good one, served in a timely manner and with a decent side dish. ANd they need to leave the pulled pork alone, it's excellent. \nI understand their beer collection is fantastic, but we aren't beer drinker so I'll just take their word. \nI'd have to say this place is a mixture of yuppie vs. dive bar vs fine dining vs. Burger King",negative,en

"Came here for a quick casual lunch before leaving for the airport to go home. We were going to come here for lunch the day prior but our group was too big and the wait was forever. But on this day, there was only 3 survivors so we got a table right away. \n\nThis place is owned by the same owners of Cheesecake Factory. That gives you the general description, price, atmosphere, of the place. \n\nWe got there in time for breakfast foods which they serve til 11am. I shared the Belgian waffles with strawberry with a side of scrambled eggs. My friend got the chillaquilles which were AMAZING. I've never had them before, and I'm not sure how they taste like anywhere else. But they were really good at this place! It's like tortilla chips topped with eggs, salsa, avocado, cheese, beans, etc. It was really good. \n\nThe server we had was great. Very friendly, talkative, and quick. However, I have one tip for the hostess stand. Apparently, the lead host takes your name and how many people in your party and finds a table on the POS system and probably because it's such a big restaurant and there are many hostesses who seat guests and the lead host doesn't have the time to stand there and wait for an actual host to come up and verbally tell them where to seat the guests, they print out a receipt thing that tells the hostess where to seat the guests. This is fine but every time she printed it out, she put it on the counter that stands between the guests and herself. So many of the guests, reach for the ticket. And she has to tell each one \""no this is not for you\"" / \""this is for the hostess\"" etc and she looked irritated each time she said it. So maybe putting it somewhere where the guests don't reach for it would make sense..",neutral,en

"I live in the neighbourhood. I visited your Desa outlet last weekend and have been a regular of your establishment for many months now. I occasionally bring my pets to dine at the pet friendly area. Your waiters stationed there are more friendly although overall they could put more effort in giving attention to local customers. The same could not be said about your staff ""Margaret"" (some woman with a pony tail & the worst attitude). I highly recommend you reprimand or fire her, as she is definitely not someone I would want to see on my next visit. (if ever I come back)On this particularly evening, my friend booked a table for 3 people & 1 pet. One other of your wait staff had seated us at a table just before the signage for the Pet friendly area. As we came and sat ourselves down, your staff Margaret had a fit, raised her voice at my friend & was lecturing us on how we should not have seated despite being directed by their own staff. Keep in mind that our dog was sitting in corner quietly sleeping, causing no trouble at all. Margaret spent 5 minutes shouting as us in front of all your customers. Me and my friends as well as nearby customers were so shocked to see this is the standards for customer service @ Social. She did not even bother to apologize because her team seated us wrongly. She could have instead seated us at the empty tables in the Pet friendly Area. Instead, she chose to just blow up at us. Unfortunately, this was not the end of it.She actually came back for a second round and shouted the exact same things to us. We had been patient the whole time and could not get a word in edgewise. So we let her rant it out but we were getting hungry. Finally,I had have enough of her lousy attitude and asked her nicely to ""pls take our order."" She replied with, ""I don't take orders, there are other staff who do that"" and she literally just walked away without a word in edgewise. We had to wait another 15 minutes to get another waiters attention. Prior to this event, I was OK with your good variety of food and slow service. However, this experience has totally changed my perception of your establishment. It is NEVER the customer's fault that your team screws up. We would have appreciated if she had skipped the drama and just sat us at different table if she was SO upset with the matter; OR the least she could do was apologise for THEIR mistake, not a 10 minutes lecture from an old angry aunty. fyi, there were plenty of other tables in the non-petfriendly area that had many small dogs. Yet, your staff Margaret chose our table to shout at. Totally unprofessional & unnecessary.",negative,en

So I think you will save about 10 bucks a person.

"Stayed here for business. Would never book here for leisure. Never with children. Service was good, but this hotel needs a major upgrade. Definetly not a 5 star hotel.

Several ""greasy spoon"" restaurants located on the 4th level, pizza, sandwiches, chips, chinese,..etc. Restaurants are a few blocks away and mostly pricey also. Traffic is miserable here, and the hotel is noisy. I was on the 23rd floor and could either hear traffic and/ or the elevators going all night long. The parking is a just plain rip off. $42 per night for hotel guests...which is not noted on their website. Shopping in this area is very slim, unless you like garment district type shopping.

"Hmmm, I have a sneaky suspicion that someone's been reading their reviews online!\n\nWhen I last wrote about Bar Kohl I got into a major hissy fit because the bartender poured red win into a cylinder to measure out the glass, and then without washing said metal cylinder, poured white into it. This was not at all A-Ok to me or my girl-date (stole that one from Jen L. ha!).\n\nHaving been back twice in the past week (end of the semester, don't judge), I have been pleasantly surprised. Not only did they wash every single glass and utensil that was used in the bar, they were extraordinarily meticulous about measurements, tasting cocktails and making sure flavours where spot on. Needless to say, I really really enjoyed the cocktails, and judging by the state of them, so did the girls.\n\nOne tiny mishap, one bartender tasted the cocktail (it was the same one with the cylinder a few weeks ago) decided he didn't like the taste, then used the same straw that he'd just stuck into his mouth to taste the cocktail again.

"Believe the hype...this place is real. We ate here on a Saturday night and the food and atmosphere is awsome. Quick Tip: make reservations or you'll be waiting for a while and do not ask for \""duck-fat fries\"" because they don't serve it anymore\n\nThis place is situated inside the Comopolitan at City Center, it sits right across from the Chandelier room (?) and from Tao. The atmosphere is very modern, hip, trendy. The server we had was awsome. She was very attentive to a larger group (we had 12 peeps) and patient with us.\n\nOn to the food: I had the fried pickles appetizer, \""Rising sun\"" burger with shoestring fries and \""Midas touch\"" beer. The fried pickles were good, they bread and deep fried a regular size pickle that is sliced lengh-wise with the bomb ass dipping sauce (forgot what it was called). Burger = I had mine done medium, and it came out perfectly with T-L-O (tomato-lettuce-onions) you really can't describe in words how good this gourmet hamburger was other than to say, its on my list of top 3 hamburgers I've eaten. I really wanted to limit what other ingredients that made up the hamburger itself. I wanted to taste the Kobe beef, and yes, please believe, all thats been said about Kobe beef. The house made bread, I think, was the perfect ingredient to the hamburger, it was fresh, not too \""doughy\"". The shoestring fries was \""eehh\"" only thing that saved the fries was the dipping sauce I had leftover from the appetizer. It was more of an afterthought.\n\nBeer = I could have gotten another one of these, Its made by Dogfish and it was really good. It really complimented my meal. \n\nNext time I'm in Sin City, I will make it a point to make another stop here",neutral,en

"I stayed at the Revere for one night while attending a meeting in Boston. From the moment I drove up, I was immediately impressed with the hotel. It is in a great location, and you can easily see that it is a sleek modern hotel. The valet asked my name and he used his earpiece to radio the front desk to let them know I have arrived. I have seen this many times before in 4 and 5 star hotels, and the Revere is billed as a 4 star hotel, but let me share some thoughts. You should know that the hotel used to be a Radisson until two weeks ago.
First, here is a tip that someone else shared on trip advisor that worked for me: If you drive they will valet park your car and charge you $45 for it. However, if you tell them you do not want to valet, it is only $34. They will not share that information with you, so just ask, if you have to valet.
Next, after parking my car and heading into the lobby, I would have expected some sort of greeting by name, since the valet had already radioed ahead of my arrival. That did not happen. I honestly do not care that it did not happen, I just thought it was strange that they went through this act for no apparent reason. They did offer a glass of champagne at check in, which is a nice touch and the front desk people were extremely polite and pleasant to talk to.
Once in my room, it was clear that it was well decorated and very modern. Beds were comfortable and the bathroom was a decent size. My balcony looked out onto the city and was very nice. I went up for a swim and to work out. The fitness room was tiny, and the pool was old, however, I believe they are doing a brand new fitness center on the first floor.
When I went back to my room I was locked out, my key would not work. I called down using this house phone by the elevators and they said they would send someone up, but they never came. When I went downstairs in my robe, I had to wait for two people to check in, before they offered me assistance. When I told them my situation, they asked why I just didn't call down?
Back in my room after using the bathroom I realized the toilet did not flush. I am pretty handy so I tried to fix it myself to no avail, so I filled a garbage can with water from the bathtub and flushed by dumping the water into the commode. I know you are probably questioning why I didn't call down, but I didn't want to wait for a maintenance guy at 11pm.
They were very nice and didn't charge me for parking because of my inconvenience with the toilet.
Overall the hotel is nice, but in no way is it 4 star yet, but I am sure if I were to return in a year, it will live up to the 4 star claim.",neutral,en

"These people ARE AMAZING. Simply Amazing. Customer service exceeds all of the levels that it could. I awkwardly parked in the parking lot with my friend. My tires popped and it was the closest place to get tires. So my friend and I was greeted by Alex. He handed both of us cold bottled water and walked us in. I was thrown back by the hospitality. I walk in there, obviously not sure what I was doing. I'm the stereotypical Asian-Woman driver that knows nothing about cars. I told Alex about my situation. I popped my tire and need assistance. While he was helping my friend with my situation, I called Ted Wiens maybe hoping that I had a warranty on the tire, which were the ones that popped. The people at Ted Wiens are a bunch if shit bags who enjoys having a stick up their ass. I told Alex that I have no way of obtaining the tire, or the donut, or whatever he was asking from my car since I do not own a jack. He said that because of my situation, he will ask one of his guy's to go meet me at my car and help put the tires on enough so I can bring it to the store and get it fully fixed. He sends Bryce to help. These workers are no joke. They were AMAZING. They were able to fix my tires in a timely manner. I was already late for work due to the issue, but it was less than an hour for them to assist me. Also, I didn't realize I had a spare in my trunk...Bryce and Alex found it for me. Alex was in the process of refunding one of the tires, but I insisted on keeping the tire I paid for. Not to mention, he gave me a full spare in case I had another accident. These workers aren't set on profit, but also the well being of their customers. That is something I truly appreciate. Alex also gave me a discount because I was stressing about money due to my wedding. He was AMAZING. I absolutely ADORE Alex and Bryce. Thank you so much for all of your help!

"Do not go to this restaurant if you have more than four people in your party! We arrived shortly after 11:00am on a Monday. It was our last meal on our way out of town. My husband and I valeted the car at Caesar's Palace and walked to Serendipity 3 with our four children. \n\nI stood in a short line to put our name on a waiting list. The lady told me it would be about 30 minutes. It didn't seem like a long time to wait at first. Then we noticed that everyone in front of us had been seated immediately. Then everyone behind us started to be seated. I asked the hostess if maybe they overlooked us. She said that there was another large party of five ahead of us then we were next. Large party of five? Since when is that large?\n\nI looked in the restaurant to see mostly four tops. I noticed about 5 more four tops were seated before us. That's when I asked to speak with a manager. I asked him why all these four tops were seated ahead of us. He said there were only a few tables that accommodated more than four. It was against company policy to move tables around due to fire hazards. What??? I've never heard something so ridiculous before. They then told us our table was almost ready. I wanted to leave, but I knew I would have to wait everywhere so we waited ten more minutes then we were seated. Btw...the day before 17 of us were seated together at The Sugar Factory in less time!\n\nThe food: way over priced, like most things on the strip. My macaroni was ok but $15 for a 8 oz bowl! My daughter loved the sliders. The meatball pizza was interestingly good. Another daughter had the kids macaroni which wasn't the best but was bigger than mine. My third daughter had cheesy eggs which were full of cheese and pretty yummy. My baby boy shared with all of us. \n\nDessert: the Frozen Mint Hot Chocolate was pretty extraordinary however! It was $14 since I got the drink for two. We also ordered a chocolate milkshake and a strawberry milkshake. They were good, but I've had the same milkshake for less than half the $10 we paid. \n\nThe redeeming qualities: our server was good, they offered a kids menu to sort of soften the blow of the bill, and the valet was free!",negative,en

"Gibby's is a very cozy steakhouse in a great location in old Montreal. I stopped in with a group of coworkers and had a very pleasant experience. The service was friendly and extremely professional. This is probably the norm for steakhouses of this caliber, but I don't typically eat at places this fancy.\n\nI ordered the \""petite\"" filet-mignon because I wasn't feeling too hungry, and that turned out to be one of the best decisions I've made in a while. It was still a very large piece of meat and I struggled to finish it. A few of my coworkers got individual steaks that could have fed a family of four. We also ordered a few bottles of wine which were all very good.\n\nOverall it was a good experience, and given its proximity to my hotel, I would likely return again.",neutral,en

"When I was living in AZ I went to BS West maybe a handful of times. Now when I come back to visit I pretty much go there anytime I'm in Scottsdale! \n\nI've only been here on Fridays & Saturdays (I hear Wednesday karaoke is supposed to be fun though) and I've never been disappointed. Most of the time when I come here its at the end of the night when I'm already a little bit tipsy anyway, which might be part of the reason I love it so much, but BS West has the funnest crowd in Scottsdale! I don't know if it's coincidence, but I noticed the past few time I've been here the place seems to be more crowded (the last Saturday I was here they were actually charging a $3 cover, which I normally HATE, but I didn't mind it here), which makes it all the more fun! \n\nThe place itself is kind of divey, but I like the layout. There's a small patio when you first walk in and one that's slightly larger in the back. There's a dance area as well as the required dance area stripper poles (which are always occupied...often times by beautiful people who I'm assuming are paid to \""hang out\"" on them...but sometimes by ummm...amateurs). The DJ usually plays good music and they're always showing the usual gay bar music videos (some are fun/campy...some I can do without). \n\nThe bartenders are awesome as well! They're friendly, move fast, and use a pretty heavy pour. \n\nWhen I'm in Scottsdale I always come to BS West!",neutral,en

رواية جميلة، مغرقة في المتاهات الشائكة والمعتمة، والهلوسات والانتقالات السريعة بين المشاهد المفككة والمتداعية في كثير من الأحيان. يطغى على القصة، أو لنقل على هلوسات حسام، الذي يدعى حسام بين الفينة والأخرى، لونين فقط؛ لون العتمة الليلية السائدة في كل جانب من جوانب غرفته والشوارع التي يمشي فيها ومظلته وذكرياته وكوابيسه، واللون الآخر هو الأخضر، هو سهى، هو الربيع الذي يهديها إياه في كل مرة، وتتلحف به في كل مرة، هو ببساطة لون عينيها ورمز لقصة حب بينهما.. لا شك أن بين اللونين يتخلله صفار الضوء الوحيد في الغرفة مما يعطي مسحة تتعلق بالمرض المحيط بحسام والذي يصيب في الغالب نفسيته وعقله، أما اللون الآخر الثانوي فهو بلا شك الأحمر.. لون الدماء التي رآها حسام، الذي يدعى حسام ويعمل مصورا حربيا خلال حرب لبنان. لون دماء الجثث التناثرة في الطرقة، الدم على أول جثة رآها في حياته، تحت الجسر، نعم، الجثة ذات البطن المبقور.. ثم يخبرنا عن أمه والدماء تسيل من العنق إلى الأسفل، وسهى .. حبيبته بالذات، أم أن ذاك قد كان حلما.. هو نفسه لا يدري، فهو يعلم أن هذه هلوسات، وهو يؤمن أن الحياة كلها عبارة عن حلم، عبارة عن وهم. أو ربما كانت تلك طريقته في امتصاص قسوة الحياة وظلمها وبطشها الذي رآه بأم عينه ووثقته كاميرته ويتوق إلى أفراغه من جمجمته على الورق. دم علاء هو الطاغي على أحزانه وهلوساته. مقتل علاء، أو انتحاره بالأحرى، هو ما يؤرقه أكثر من قضية انفصاله عن سهى، فلقائه مع الياس وربيع لا شك كان موعدا لحسابه كيف ترك علاء يواجه هذا المصير المشؤوم. كيف لم يستطع أن يثنيه، كيف ترك علاء، أحد الفرسان الثلاثة، أن يقدم على هكذا فعلة.. هل هو يدعى حسام أم لا، هل قصته متخيلة أم لا، هل كان فعلا فلاحا أم مصورا أم مدرسا أم عاملا في مزرعة دجاج، لا أحد يعرف. هو نفسه لا يعرف.. لكنه يدعى حسام بالتأكيد.. ربما.. لا يهم.. فالحياة كلها لا يهم.. كلها وهم في وهم.,positive,ar

"7 января решил воспользоваться интернетом для получения микрозайма и при подтверждении карты для перечисления займа каким-то образом был перенаправлен на фишинговый сайт, где благополучно списались все деньги с моей дебетовой карты без подтверждающей смс. Узнал об этом, когда увидел списания, зайдя в личный кабинет, при этом находясь в другом городе и оставшись без денег. В чате оперативно обратился по ситуации, карта была заблокирована. Далее началась идентификация меня как клиента по видеосвязи. Пришлось обратиться 5 раз в контакт центр, так как мой оператор (МТС) антиспам блокировал все входящие звонки из банка, а при самостоятельном обращении в контакт-центр приходилось постоянно объяснять ситуацию с самого начала из-за смены операторов при каждом звонке (новый оператор не знал работы предыдущего оператора). Благодаря последнему оператору, имя Юлия вроде(?) помогла мне разобраться. Был оформлен перевыпуск новой карты. и заблокирована старая карта. Вернувшись в Москву, 9 января состоялась встреча с представителем банка для получения карты. В этот раз Банк сработал оперативно и доставил в срок, в отличие от первого раза при доставки карты в Санкт-Петербург. Выражаю огромную благодарность Банку за возврат украденных денежных средств мошенниками и особую благодарность представителю Максиму, который доставил карту в обозначенный срок и вовремя, правильно презентовал услуги банка и внушил доверие к банку, а ещё сомг выдать мне Сим-Карту с красивым номером подходящим по моей натальной карте и лёгким для запоминания )), приятно был удивлён.

I agree that it may need some renovations because a lot of the furniture and overall design seems very dated.

"Just stayed at PHT with my girlfriends this past weekend. The location of the building is a bit difficult to get to cuz it's not off the strip. Lobby is huge. No smoking allowed here. That's my extra star. \n\nWhen I checked in, nothing special. I was hoping this girl would upgrade us but she said I could upgrade for add'l $40 more a night for a one bedroom suite. No thanks. I thought I reserved the one bedroom suite. We got the small studio suite. Nothing fancy, really. It was nice to have a kitchenette though. We were able to store all of our drinks in the fridge. There was a dishwasher, extra dishes, utensils, a microwave. Nice flatscreen. LOVE the black out shades, especially after a long night.\n\nWe were on the 50th floor and the water pressure in the shower really sucked. The tub was a jacuzzi. Didn't use it though. Contrary to what other reviewers said, we had an ice machine on our floor and had housekeeping come in. We were still getting ready so they came back in the afternoon to clean up. They gave us extra towels too. \n\nNo hair dryer in the room. Safe in the closet, but ours didn't work. There was a small closet and an ironing board. Wifi's not free. We had a king size bed that was super comfy and tons of pillows. We also had a queen pull out bed, which I heard was pretty comfy also. The room was a little dirty. I guess they had turned on the dishwasher and water had leaked onto the counter which made the black counter white. The walls were disgusting!! There was some type of liquid on the walls, near the bed. Could be spit...or some other bodily fluids. Overall, the stay was good. I would stay here again, if the price was right. The nonsmoking completely hooked me at PHT and it's direct access to the mile long shops at PH.",neutral,en

Chinese food...the dimsum is delicious, but the tea egg tasteless....I would prefer some seasoning in it, the soy milk is not hot enough as well the bread fritter is not crispy and puffy....it's starting to cold5. Bagel station is a good idea to enhance something new in buffet experience but the size of bagel seems like a la carte portion....too big for buffet....it will be lovely in a smaller cute size, anyway ur chef is friendly enough to recommend me a good salmon bagel...juz the size too big6.

Arabic selection the hummus and babaganoush doesn't taste authentic enough....lack of lemon juice and tahini I guess...labneh need to be more times to dry up I guess....8.

"INTRO: I stayed at this property for 1 night while working in the DC area. The hotel room was prearranged by others and not chosen by me.
PROPERTY: This is an older traditional style property, which means outdated and not up to par with similar hotels. It reminds me of an older Holiday Inn, which I’m not a big fan of. I stayed in room 732 which is a standard double/double room. The room was average sized and fairly clean.
ROOM: The room had its own, window mounted A/C unit which was anemic and ineffective. The windows were so old and thin you can hear the street noise below. There is moderate street and airport noise in the room, which lessened after 9:00 pm. The furniture was OK and had a 32” flat screen. Lighting in the room was poor
NO COFFEE MAKER IN THE ROOM. How ridiculous.....
The bathroom was updated and has solid surface counters and tile which look nice. Upscale soaps and shampoos were provided.
BEDDING: The bed was poor and bowed in the middle. The pillows were cheap, but new and hard. The bedding was clean.
WORK AREA: It had a good size work desk and a good chair. Only three receptacles for electronics. Poor work area lighting.
The staff was cordial, but not overly friendly.
RATING: Overall I would give the property a 68/100 and 75/100 for value. I would likely look elsewhere if I were in this area again..
PROS: Price, location, fairly clean.
CONS: Noise, NO COFFEE MAKER, old",neutral,en

"We have stayed in a lot of hotels and this was by far the worst experience we have had beyond a $2 room in India. The cleaning staff were either mentally challenged or just utterly incompetent. Found dirty clothing in our room that were not ours and God only knows how long it had been there. Upon returning from work there would maybe be 1 bath towel for 2 persons; perhaps a clean robe or the one we left on the floor would still be sitting there; maybe we would have cleans sheets but after 5 days had to call about that too; the bathroom mirror was rarely touched; and the list goes on. If this had been a Motel 6 perhaps this would have been OK. But certainly this was unexpectedly disgusting and unbelievably poor management to have occurred from what they describe as a quality, boutique hotel. Upon informing management of these issues it was usually met with a, ""oh we will send a towel up"", not a ""wow we will check our cleaning staff and make sure they are actually performing their jobs, we are very sorry you found someone else's dirty clothes in your room"". Seriously neither of us ever complain about hotels, and neither of us have ever called the front desk to complain, but this stay was so utterly awful we felt we should warn others. Dupont is a great location but there are other hotels close by that are far better. Perhaps this was once a nice hotel but the only thing remaining are the welcoming men at the front door.",negative,en

"""Zabriskie Point"" (1970): This was especially interesting to me on a personal level, since it takes place under identical circumstances, with identical peers, in my own life  the Counter Culture movement of the late 60's/early 70's, on and off campus. We follow two unrelated young people in separate stories, who are slowly woven together. One is a young man in Los Angeles, tired of all the endless, pseudo-revolutionary jabber in the classrooms and lunchrooms of his campus, and, the other, a young woman driving to Phoenix to see her father & employer, and take on an ""establishment"" job. The film is FULL of our Italian director's (Michelangelo Antonioni) visual notations of America, and, the confused, psychedelicrazies of that era's self-righteous, ""we know it all, we'll change everything for the better"" youth. Just who IS the ""revolutionary""? What does that REALLY mean? Do you dress like one and march around chanting? Do you ""fly in under the radar"" but give advance notice of your arrival? Do you keep your plans to yourself, and go about the business of change, with no need for group approval? ""Zabriskie Point"" is definitely a ""period piece"" - full of slang, uniforms, somewhat surreal film moments (after all, this is a film by the man who gave us the amazing ""Blow Up"" of 1966), and the era's artifacts, but it is more. It presents options for cultural revolution, and going by Antonioni (who DOES seem to be supportive of it), the youth are too self-involved to see what is needed for radical success. Because of this, it becomes a powerful, frightening film that applies to anyone, any time, any place.",positive,en

This hotel is easy to find if you follow the directions from the hotel and not on mapquest. The outside could use a facade update but was clean. The lobby area is okay, but is dark. My husband said he felt claustrophobic all weekend in the hotel.
The bedding was excellent. The room was large. The room was clean. The air didn't really ever work right, but it did run. It was annoying the way it would run for 30 seconds then turn off.
Breakfast was included in the rate and was quite good. There were scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, gravy, biscuits, fruit, cereal, juices and milk included. If you weren't staying at the hotel breakfast was $6.

"My friend and I had a cancelled flight and ended up needing to spend the night in Phoenix (which delayed our vacation starting one day). We chose the Embassy Suites for our one night stay and found the hotel to be nothing short of delightful.
The property was lovely. The pool was so nice with shady areas and lots of pool ""toys"" including things to float on. We enjoyed the pool a great deal! Our room was spacious and clean. The lobby was lovely and the eating areas very nice. But what set this place apart was the service. Everyone who worked here was friendly, funny, and welcoming. We ended up feeling not like our vacation was delayed in starting but like we had a mini vacation in Phoenix. From our airport pick-up to our airport drop-off the next day everyone was exceedingly helpful.
The suites have a shuttle bus and they are willing to take you anywhere within a five mile radius for free as long as they aren't doing an airport pick-up. We were looking for a place to get Indian tacos. The front desk looked it up for us, took us there to get food, and brought us back no problem. There is a manager's reception in the cafe each afternoon and we got free drinks and there were also snacks to eat. We went up there to wait for our shuttle to dinner and they just called the bar when they were ready to take us. The made to order breakfast the next morning was fast and delicious!!! The man cooking it up was adorable and came over to make sure our food was good.
I just don't have a word of complaint about this facility. I have no idea about the area we were staying in since we weren't there to sight-see but for a reasonable place to stay with excellent service - you can't beat this place.",positive,en
"The Great Dane Pub in downtown Madison was only a short walk from my hotel. I don't know what it would be like to find parking if I had driven here.\n\nThe place is huge. I didn't realize it at first, but it is like three bars in one. There is the small pub with bar and some high tables, a large game room pub with another bar and pool tables, and then there is the \""cave\"" in the basement with yet another dimly lit bar and booths. (This would have been more my style, but I didn't discover it until I went looking for the men's room which is also in the basement.)\n\nAs usual we camped at the bar and ordered a sampler. The bartender served us with a smile. The ten samples were presented on a large wooden dog bone shaped tray.\n\nThe beers were all drinkable, but there were too many lites, pilsners and other \""safe\"" versions of beer styles for my taste. (Unfortunately for the Dane, I had spent several hours earlier in the day at a pub with a much tastier selection.)\nI didn't settle in for a long session at the Great Dane, but if I was going to, then I might have had a pint of the Crop Circle Wheat, Devils Lake Red Lager or the Black Earth Porter. \n\nThe food that we had was tasty. The Drunken Jerk wasn't me for a change, but it was what I ate. The marinade, with a mix of sweet and spice nicely complemented the meat. It would have been perfect if the meat was more tender. They really should have taken the time to cook it until it was falling apart. My wife's Sustain-A-burger was juicy and delicious.\n\nI spent about two hours at the Great Dane on a Thursday evening and it was hopping the whole time. One thing that I noticed both in this pub and on the street, is that downtown Madison seems to have a high density of attractive young women. I am a happily married man, but I thought I would add that to my review for all you eligible bachelors out there.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed my visit to the Great Dane Pub in downtown Madison. The food was tasty, the atmosphere was fun. The beer was OK, but not great. If this place was in my neighborhood, I would definitely be a regular. The beer is the deciding factor for me though. I wish I could give this place a 3.5, but I cannot justify a 4 until the beer ranks up there with other fine Madison area breweries.",negative,en

"The part where Meg visits the mechanic and he says - ""Is the piston firing short?"" (implying poor sexual energy on the part of her fiancée) was hilarious. I love Meg Ryan and she is as sweet as ever in this wonderful movie. Very lovable and very intelligent too. Her innocent indignant expressions have you wishing she was yours. The hero handles the garage mechanic to physicist transformation well. Einstein had a romantic side to his psyche? The puzzle round in front of the press and audience was done well. It's awfully underrated and deserves accolades and attempts at a revival. It loses out one vote for including the highly improbable far fetched theory being bought by the US Govt.

"Let me get this off my chest before I review the hotel - After a long day of travel and airport delays with a 2 year old, and after a few glasses of wine, it would have taken a freight train to wake me from my slumber. Unfortunately, that is exactly what happened - and I was on the top 22nd floor. Our suite (2205) faced the back of the hotel (the opposite of the pool), and at 1:30am, 4am, 5:15 and 6:30am a train blew it's whistle at every intersection, so it went on for at least five minutes each time. Now, I'm not one to complain, I understand the street level noise, the groups drinking and yelling, cars honking. But this was so loud and so long, it will prevent me from staying here again. It was that bad. Every night. It was so bad I called the desk on the 2nd night at 5am to ask for another suite, but none were available. The guy said they obviously have no control over the train, and that sometimes it is 3 or 4 nights in a row, sometimes just one night. We got 4 nights. I am not blaming the hotel, nothing they can do, but I cannot stay here again unless I am on the opposite side of the hotel - our friends had a room facing the pool and had no noise problems. We walked around like zombies the whole vacation from being up all night.
The Hotel: The hotel is in a decent location, on the Riverwalk. My wife had to go to the convention hall, it is a good walk (0.4 miles) - very do-able. But she is pregnant and combined with the Texas heat, she took a cab, $5 bucks each way. The garage is at the hotel, I see no reason to use the valet. The garage is kind of tight parking spaces (minivan), but we never had a problem parking. The staff (front desk) were very friendly and helpful (upon request, within 5 min they had maintenance oiling our hinges on door because it woke or daughter up). The pool and pool area is VERRRRY small - this should be considered if you have kids and plan on swimming every day with them. Also, just a note - we usually go to the pool after sightseeing etc, anywhere from 3pm-6pm - be advised there is no sun on the pool between those hours, but any other time of day or evening, there is sun (if you can find a place to lay (small area)) The towels they provide at the pool are like the size of facecloths. The restaurant was decent for a quick bite before heading out. Don't expect a grand lobby upon entering the hotel. My wife thought the fitness center was lousy, like 3 machines total (one eliptical)
The Rooms: We got a suite. Reasonably priced. They had a good size bedroom and good size living area with chairs, love seat (with pull out bed) and a table and chairs, sink and fridge. The bathroom was in the bedroom, I thought the layout was odd, it should be in the living are, but I'm no interior designer. The big drawback on the room was lack of storage. There was one 3 draw dresser in the bedroom and one in the living room. There was adequate free space in the bedroom for another bureau or dresser. The room was clean, but just sort of felt dated / worn / tired. But it was clean. The bathtub could be updated. The bed was very comfortable and pillows were decent. We tried to have a drink on one of our two balconies, but the city living noise was too much to relax and enjoy the night air. Free wifi, which was good since the tv stations are limited (how about printing out a channel guide?).
Overall, if you take the train out of the equation, the rating goes up to 4. See HobartLane's restaurant reviews in San Antonio on Yelp.",positive,en

"This review is for the Restaurant Week 2010 prix fixe menu.\n\nIn a nutshell, nice view but for the price I'd much rather go elsewhere. Not at all satisfied even with the discount price I paid.\n\nFirst of all, I tried making reservations online but a deposit was required, not sure if that's opentable.com's rule or Alize's but that's dumb. I called in instead however they had a less than favorable time available than that of the one that cost money upfront. That really should have been my first indication not to go here. \n\nSo my boyfriend and I had the following:\n\nFirst Course: Lobster Bisque & Field Greens and Herbs \n\nMy soup was good however umm there was no lobster in it. And I would have preferred to put the Puff Pastry Croutons in myself because it got soggy and I kept hoping it was a chunk of lobster. While the presentation of the salad was nice the Caraway Cracker made it difficult to eat and there wasn't enough dressing.\n\nSecond Course: Salmon, Asparagus, Idaho Potato & King Crab Croustillant B\u00e9arnaise Cromesquis and the Grilled Ribeye \nGruy\u00e8re Potato Pur\u00e9e, Asparagus ,Red Wine Beef Jus\n\nThe salmon and steak were cooked well and the portions were big but the amount of sides to eat with it was inadequate. While both were pretty good, neither were great. Felt more like a chore to finish it.\n\nThird Course: Cr\u00e8me Br\u00fbl\u00e9e and Souffl\u00e9 du Jour\nThe Souffl\u00e9 wasn't rich enough for me. It sort of tasted like they poured nesquick into it. Good thing they poured my white russian well. It made my souffle worth eating. The Cr\u00e8me Br\u00fbl\u00e9e could have been smoother maybe or less thick but it was good anyhow and I enjoyed it.\n\nWe got the 2 course wine pairing for an extra $10 each. The Chardonnay for the appetizer was light and yummy. The bf liked his Cabernet but my second glass (forgot what) was yucky! \n\nService: The staff was very nice. However you kind of got the feeling like they were watching you like hawks. I'm sure it was because they were trying to refill or bring out/clear stuff in a timely manner. But it was still a little uncomfortable and we felt rushed. We were out in like an hour flat and didn't get to enjoy the view as much or have a minute to digest.\n\nAlso, when reserving they mention proper attire which is to be expected but there was a group of dudes in cargo shorts, t shirts, and flip flops. So much for dress code.",negative,en

"This hotel is fantastic. I won't stay any where else while on business in Charlotte. The rooms are modern, spacious and luxurious. The king size bed is exceptionally comfortable. The bathroom with the walk in shower and tub is luxurious; especially the double shower heads. Every so often, I request for an room upgrade for a treadmill in my room for convenience.\n\nThe gym has an indoor pool and all the amenities for a great workout. They provide disposable earphones to connect to the personal tv monitors on each treadmill and elliptical machine. The hotel also offers in-room message service from a local spa; which I haven't tried.\n\nI love when Westin and SPG offers double and triple points. In addition, the hotel offers bonus points for green cleaning.\n\nStar reward:\n1) love the room comforts.\n2) an on premise Starbucks.\n3) free airline checkin.\n4) free room upgrades.\n5) additional location SPG points.\n\nStar deductions:\n1) the hotel bar is lacking ambiance.\n2) a cheesy roadhouse style bar is directly behind the property and blasts country music until 2am when rented out during Panther game nights. Make sure to ask for the high floors to get a good night sleep.\n3) mediocre hotel restaurant for breakfast and dinner.\n4) free wifi only in the lobby/lounge.",neutral,en

"Swift's socialism and pacifism come through against all odds in this well done remake. (Did you know there is no hyphen after ""well""? Fact.) He meets warlike miniatures, socialist giants, head-in-the-clouds (literally) philosophers, and pacifist horses who rule over Yahoos -- nearly neanderthal humanoids. (Is that where ""yahoo"" came from?) We also meet the dastardly Dr. Bates, the devoted Mary Gulliver, the sweet and devoted son Thomas, and the full cast of a truly horrific 19th century lunatic asylum. Suspension of disbelief comes easily, and our 7- and 12-year-old girls enjoyed it as much as my husband and I did. (Sorry for the length, IMDb requires 10 lines.)",positive,en

"Bateau ivre à la dérive, dans la violence d'un tourbillon orange à vous couper Le Souffle, louvoyant dans les doubles reflets du Miroir et du Sacrifice (Offret) de Tarkovski, Errance reflète le regard poétique d'un Petit Prince sur la violence de ses parents envers eux-mêmes. Au nom de cet enfant, sa mère reste avec ce mauvais mari, violent, plombé par la bière, impliqué dans des affaires douteuses à cause d'un ancien compagnon d'armes, souvenir d'une guerre de l'autre côté du miroir méditerranéen. Les mots sont économes. Tout est intériorisé dans le regard. Les réactions instinctives de louve maternelle parlent de façon éloquente pour Laetitia Casta solaire particulièrement remarquable. La violence du film se reflète jusque dans les interviews et les critiques assassines référençant un mythe à double consonne. Odoul clôt lui-même ce triptyque autobiographique du double.

Mitchell Leisen achève le tout avec une réalisation élégante et très bien rythmée où il atteint des sommets dignes de Lubitsch.

"3.5 starBRIEF SUMMARYAmber is excited when she meets her high school crush, Brain. Both had an instant attraction that led to a steamy encounter. When both encounters a misunderstanding, they still manage to not get along but physically wants and take each other repeatedly.THOUGHTSI thought this was a very spicy book. I am always first in line to read high school crushes who reunites later in life. Amber and Brain got together for a steamy night, but, with a misunderstanding everything goes wrong. Soon after and unable to get enough of each other with their bedroom aerobics, both characters steams up the pages with a sex only relationship. I liked that even though the relationship was purely sexual, we got to see Brain slowly learning and reconnecting more about Amber, and I found that to be sweet. Although I thought this story was sexually charged, and sweet, I found the storyline to be ok. I liked it, but didn't find myself connecting with certain scenes. Nevertheless, I would still recommend this book.Story: FAIRIntimacy: D.R.I.P = Don't Read In Public / GOODEnjoyment: FAIR to GOODRomance Novel Junkies",neutral,en

"I went to San Francisco as a single traveler/tourist for a few days, and my goal was to find a hotel that was clean, comfortable, and affordable. I did get what I was looking for. There were a few quirks that made me decide I'd never stay here again though. The acoustics are pretty poor, I could easily hear pipes and sinks running in rooms adjacent to mine, and my toilet made a wheezing, cricket-like noise almost constantly. The carpet looks a bit dated, its obvious that this is an older hotel that was recently renovated. The website promotes wifi, but I had problems getting access and had to get a short ethernet cord from the desk, it defeated the purposed of wireless and left me stuck at the desk. It has an old fashioned style, but clean, spacious rooms and nice staff. If you want to be completely satisfied, pay the extra money and stay at a 4 star hotel, if you need quick comfort, stay here. Its right next to a major stop for the cable cars, and about four blocks away from a BART station.

Деревенский сервис: мы 30 минут сдавали номер, девушка горничная проверяла каждый сантиметр постельного белья, а когда увидела размазанную мошку на наволочке, то предложила нам ее застирать, а может ещё надо было после себя окна помыть? (возникает вопрос, стирается ли вообще постельное белье между гостями, раз не дай бог будет пятнышко 🤔). Горничная Считала количество стаканов, тарелок, включала пустой чайник. Алло?

I would not have gone for a themed hotel anywhere, but it didn't make any difference for us. It has a nautical theme if you're interested...
Staff were friendly and helpful, in contrast to another recent review I found the Concierge / Bell staff to be very helpful and ameniable to my many questions for help and advice.
I failed to book the Alcatraz trip in advance and missed out, but that is nobodies fault but my own (book before you arrive!)
The hotel is in the shell of an old wharf building, not designed for habitation and very dark (at least in the reception area). Our room was also fairly dark, but not one of the best in terms of position which I imagine could be rectified with a paid upgrade...
The room was clean and appropriately kitted out for the hotel rating with no unpleasent discoveries, other than the TV/Internet facility which was faulty, and the fridge that periodically made a humming/vibrating noise, this was not that much of a big deal though. To my mind I would expect stuff like this unless I was staying in a 5 star + (but I am English). Good air con.
Didn't eat in the restaurant.
Free wine ('tasting') at about 5pm in reception every day was a nice touch and a chance to socialise with other guests.
Biggest plus for this hotel is the location. Although Fishermans Wharf is a bit of a dump with limited charm or appeal, it is a good place to be based as a tourist. You have the Cable car next door to the hotel which takes you over the hills of the city down into Union Square (where the shops are), it is a good point to walk or cycle to the Golden Gate bridge (1.5 hours - 2 hours walk) along the bay. You can also walk to other places of interest. There is also a buzz about the place (Fishermans Wharf).",negative,en

Let's face it, if you're trying to eat right by incorporating salads in the usual method of trying to fill up on protein not fatty foods when you're dining, then i strongly recommend this place. There's only a handful of restaurants I can count where sometimes I can't eat the whole salad and these extra large portions can be a challenge.

"I stayed here for a weekend marathon event, so the price was a little higher than usual (but expected). It is located on the fringes of Chinatown and right across the street from the convention center. This could be a great location or not depending on where you plan on going during your trip. The hotel is also right next to the Reading Terminal Market, which we visited twice during our 1 night stay. The market has fantastic food and music...it is highly recommended. The hotel staff was extremely helpful and nice, and my room (Jr Suite) was clean and comfortable. My one complaint was the noise. The hotel did not seem to be insulated at all from outside noise, hallway noise, or even noise from the room next door. Being in a city, I expected the outside street noise. What I didn't expect was to be able to hear my neighbor's TV or people casually talking in the hallway at a normal volume. I probably would only stay here again if I needed to be close to the convention center. Oh, and parking was pricey ($33/day), but not out of the norm for city parking.",negative,en

I also like the free peanuts while you wait for your order. I ordered a little burger with bacon and the bacon was fantastic. It was crispy and they were not stingy with it. My husband ordered a regular cheeseburger. He said the cheese wasn't that great. I like the fact that they are hand formed patties but mine was falling apart which was kind of annoying. The fries were really good as well and I would like to go back to try the cajun style ones. On a side note, my sister went into the bathroom while we were there and she said it was clean and smelled like cinnamon so thats a plus as well! Overall, the food was good, but nothing to die for.",negative,en

"For all the reviews that say this is a cute and great location hotel have never been off the porch. The staff were great, the bed comfortable. The rest is a nightmare, 10 x 12 room, shower in the closet with no place to turn around or when you get out of the shower your in the room. The elevator would not hold 2 persons plus a baggage cart, the outside noise (cars, buses, emergency equipment) were on all night. The food in the restraurant was not too bad. Parking fee 36.50 plus 5.00 tip= 41.50 per day to park..We had to stay downtown, but will never stay at the Max Hotel again never..

Fish was very tasty - not sure why our waitress found it so hard to grasp the concept of having fish chips and mushy peas together. She ended up together swapping out our chips for mushy peas.

"I recently went to the pro gun club for a charity sporting clays shoot that was put on by the Southern Nevada homebuilders charity home aid of Nevada. The event took place at the pro-gun club and pro-gun club partnered with these groups to put on a very good event. The program started on time all of the sporting clay targets were set correctly and there were menus at every station indicating the pairs, the order of target presentation that was prepared by club staff. I didn't have a single target come out broken, the machines were working and everything ran smoothly so it's obvious that they have spent the right amount of money in buying good machines and then keeping them up-to-date.\n\nPro GC obviously has the ability to vary their target presentation from the multiple shooting stations that they have on their sporting clays course which covers a large loop. What this does is it gives the club the opportunity to change the difficulty of a program depending upon the level of shooter, and this made the event enjoyable for a group of people who aren't necessarily there to set world records or compete in an NSCA event. The clubhouse was maintained well, they have clean restrooms a pro shop with ammo sales, the parking is good and there's lots of other things to do aside from sporting. They also have full auto rentals and different ranges where you can shoot targets full auto and even mount a machine gun to an APC and fire at an old junk car. There are some membership options also.",positive,en

"We stayed in this hotel for two nights after spending time in DC and Virginia. I called the hotel on my way up and said that we will be taking light rail from Penn Station to the hotel and asked what stop we should get off at. The person I spoke with told me the stop, but neglected to tell me that the light rail was not running because of the Grand Prix.
We arrived at the hotel and was greeted by a staff member -- there seemed to always be someone by the door outside. The front desk staff was not rude, but not friendly either. Whenever we asked someone at the front desk a question, they were polite but acted like we had interrupted them from doing something important.
The hotel itself was clean and pleasant. Our room was spacious -- we had a living room and a seperate bedroom. I wasn't crazy about the bathroom setup -- the sink was outside of the bathroom and was kind of in the bedroom area. We could hear the Grand Prix from our room but did not hear other street noise.
On our first full day in Baltimore, we came back to our room at about 4:00 p.m to find that housekeeping had not made up our room. We had our do not disturb sign on until about 10:30 a.m., but took it off around that time when we left for the day. We were irritated but didn't do anything about it. At about 4:30, housekeeping knocked on our door and asked if they could make up the room. At that point, we had been out all day and just wanted to relax, so we told them no and just asked for more towels. I thought this was poor service -- I stay at a lot of hotels and typically rooms are made up in the late morning or early afternoon when most guests are out.
The location of the hotel is nice. It is a very short walk to the Inner Harbor and Power Plant Live. You can also walk to Harbor East. I believe that public transportation is available around the hotel, but it's hard for me to speak definitively because a lot of the routes were screwed up for the Grand Prix.
The breakfast was above average with a lot of hot and cold options. There was plenty of seating in the breakfast room. The bar ""17 Light"" had great drink specials. The staff at the bar/restaurant was similar to the front desk staff -- not rude, but not friendly either.
The fitness center was ok -- the machines were pretty modern and had an iPod/iPhone dock. The wifi worked well.",neutral,en

"I understand ""Checking Out"" will likely be released in Theatres in the USA in June 2006, and on DVD in November 2006. My recommendation is to not miss ""Checking Out""!! This Comedy Film will entertain everyone, who will all relate to the characters, family relationships and multiple social issues that are portrayed. ""Checking Out"" will make you laugh throughout with quick fire clever humor built into almost every line, and may make you poignantly cry in a touching positive way as well. The subject of suicide is dealt with in a comical way, that at the same time may help people considering it understand the impacts this act may have on those their life has touched and on those who love them. Lets hope that ""Checking Out"" can have a positive impact and help prevent those considering suicide from acting it out, especially in the 16-25 age group that has the highest rate of suicide in the USA. The script is wonderfully written, perfectly casted, and loaded with synchronicity and meaningful flashbacks in time, whose significance become more apparent throughout the film and especially at the ending. I believe the script is worthy of an Academy Award Nomination for ""Best Screenplay, Play to a Movie"" ( The Phoenix Film Festival honored ""Checking Out"" with a ""Best Screenplay Award"" ).The cast is loaded with great actors that out do themselves, and have a long track record of great performances, acting award nominations and wins. I feel Peter Falk's performance in ""Checking Out"" is worthy of an Academy Award Nomination, and is the most challenging and wide ranging of his career. Laura San Giacomo's performance and chemistry with Peter Falk as her father is masterful, and was recognized at the Palm Beach International Film Festival with a ""Best Actress Award.""Even the teenage characters in the movie shine and are played by young acting phenoms Dan Byrd ( Movies: A Cinderalla Story with Hilary Duff; 3 Young Artist Award nominations, Won 1 ) and Mary Elizabeth Winstead ( TV: Monster Island, Wolf Lake, Passions, Touched by an Angel; 2 Young Star Nominations ).Director Jeff Hare and Producer Mark Lane wonderfully develop the characters, their interrelationships, and the story line of this entertaining, enjoyable yet complex script.The film editing keeps the pace of the film moving quickly, only appropriately slowing in the poignant scenes, so that the audience will never loose interest from the beginning to the end.Don't miss this film that you can take the whole family to see and all will enjoy it.",positive,en

Got there and found the place closed! Not cool. Waited a bit as there were others waiting in the parking lot too, and they finally opened, half hour after my reservation! But once we were in the buffet lunch was pretty good. I stuck with the vegetarian, which was excellent. Others members of my group who had the non veg were disappointed; the tandoori looked like it was from the night before and the masala chicken had about 3 pieces in a vat of curry sauce (literally, I saw it for myself!). Also, there wasnt enough staff; it took forever to get out naan, chai, coffee.

"We saw the hotel as the plane landed - that was nice. The lobby is very large, and a bit dated. Expected and received nice service - especially since the room first given us had a strong smell of mold, and visible mold around the air vent. We were switched to another room without a problem, and there was no problem there. The room was a bit small, and had 2 full beds, I expected queen or king. I did not ask to change again, because we were tired and traveling with 2 kids. The special feature of the bed that adjusts the hardness of the bed with the touch of a button was NOT so special when 2 people tried to sleep on the bed. For bigger beds there are two controls for L and R sides, but not on the smaller bed.
We ate in the lounge and enjoyed really good service and meals. But, I liked least that the pool was closed and this wasn't communicated before I booked. Not sure if I would stay again.",positive,en

Rarement la douleur de vivre a pu être exprimé avec tant de justesse dans la rage brute et crue qu'elle peut provoquer. La rage est le versant du desespoir, un fil du rasoir les sépare, ce film reste du côté de la rage, de l'énergie sans nier l'autre versant. Merci à Jalil Lespert, Sami Bouajila et Benoit Magimel (incroyable de justesse et de sincérité) et aux 2 formidables actrices que je ne connaissais pas. Il est a la fois effrayant et rassurant de voir que la nouvelle génération d'acteur (à laquelle j'ajouterais notamment Roschdy Zem et Marie José Croze) sait être le reflet des douleurs autant que de la rage de vivre de notre époque.

This hotel has a beautiful lobby, good bar downstairs, and excellent location if you want to be in Times Square, but this is where the thrills end. The room is about the size of a decent size closet...the only place I remember having rooms this small in the city is the Hudson Hotel (but atleast those are gorgeous rooms). The Stay has dark and depressing rooms..very dark colors, which in my opinion was a horrible color choice for rooms of this size. My husband and I nearly wanted to forfit the $439 we spent on the night we were gauged into paying last week but there was no other place to stay. (Now we know why) The room seemed clean, the TV was nice and the bed was comfortable, but it was so dark and depressing that unless you get these rooms at a very good price I would not stay here.

"Curacao to Bonaire with Insel Air - this is a 15 min flight. My flight was at 7am. I needed to check in before 6am. At check-in they simply told me the flight was now at 9.15am and boarding at 8.45am. No reason, no sorry, nothing. I had to wait 2 hours and was to late for my business meeting. Great thing about CUR-BON is you receive your return ticket at departure check-in. This means you can usually walk in 15 min before flying and you're still in time. This usually works great, but I received a call from Insel Air at 6.40pm when just starting with my main course at my business dinner. Your flight is leaving 1h15m earlier. I had to be in at 7.30pm instead of 9pm. Hurried my dinner and business meeting, turned in my car and was in at 7.29pm. This was stupid of me of course because Insel Air never do what they say. I flew at 9.20pm (5 min later than my normal flight). Meaning I hurried for nothing and lost a total of 5 hours of business in Bonaire on a round flight of only 30 min. I really hate this airline and don't understand that they can do this everytime. They cancel flights like it's nothing just to fill up 1 plane.

Two large fluffy biscuits topped with yummy gravy exploding with sausage! He got his with mashed potatoes, I got mine with crispy potatoes, and they were excellent. I think it was only about $12 to $14 for the biscuits and gravy, which would have been great if we would have shared! :) The bloody Mary was just ok, it was pretty bland, I had to keep dumping Tabasco in it. The food is delicious, everyone enjoyed their meals... Supposedly everything is farm fresh and made from scratch.

"My sister took us to lunch here yesterday, Friday 4/23. On our way to AC, she mentioned that she and her coworkers have lunched here on several occasions, and her favorite is the chicken pita with tzadziki sauce and a side salad. I asked if it was called chicken shawarma, and she replied no, so I gathered that she was speaking of grilled chicken pita with tzatziki sauce with the usual salad stuffing (lettuce, tomatoes, pickle). We arrived and found a couple of people waiting to order, as well as a few waiting for their take-out orders. I spied an elderly couple cooking in the kitchen, and I assumed their son or a relative was manning the counter and register. Based on the food I had here, I'd readily give 4 stars, but long wait times, which could've been easily rectified by adding another cook (or two) plus another person to help the slow order-taker/cashier/server/busser, warrant 2 stars or even less!\n\nSister ordered two #31's (marinated chicken breast sandwich; $5.50) and two Greek side salads ($1.95 each). All sandwiches come with tomato, onions, and lettuce with tzadziki sauce and wrapped in a grilled pita. I ordered the Greek gyro salad ($6.95), minus the cucumbers and salad dressing, but add more feta crumbles, please. (I've included photos of a sandwich.)\n\nI wish I could remark on the chicken sandwiches, but sadly for me, the tzatziki sauce was all over them. They looked scrumptious, though! My sis said that AC's cucumber sauce is the best she's ever tried. Mom says she's had better- we've eaten at many mediterranean restaurants over the years. I LOVED the gyro! Awesome grill tan, and the flavors were spectacular, not in the least bit greasy, and I looked forward to and relished every bite! The salad bed on which the gyro was resting on was equally tasty, even though the dressing, which I had requested to be omitted, was included; It added the perfect tang and spices to the dish- definitely worth a few hours of discomfort. Really liked the salty feta. \n\nI'd definitely return on my next visit to the Queen City... I'd go back in a heartbeat on this visit if there weren't so many other places I'd like to check out (and yelp about) first!\n\nOne small complaint- the kitchen had run out of \""yellow\"" rice, which I assumed to be seasoned with saffron. Shame, since I love saffron rice, and it would've been nice to try their version of it. Funny that the kitchen staff was lacking on a Friday during lunch hours (we ordered at 1pm and received our food 25 minutes later), was already short on pantry items, and it wasn't busy at all. No wonder Eric K. left before ordering any food...",negative,en
First time here so we bought the regular tickets which by the way you can put towards an annual membership. Really fun place to go.

There are a number of trails that you can walk and look at the different types of plants and then there's a botanical garden that is really cool but I recommend going in the morning before gets too hot.

ハード１でプレイしました。原作を変えるなとは言わないが、変えるのであればもっとよく考えて変えるべきだと思う。 商業的に成功させるためにはライトユーザーにもヘビーユーザーにも広く対応したいけれど、それぞれのために大掛かりに作りこむのは避けたい。だからパラメーターと敵配置をいじることで難易度調整を済ませたい。そうすると、特定の兵種をロストした場合に(高難易度では)詰んでしまうので兵種変更を入れた、というところだと感じられる。 「嫌ならば使わなければ良い」という意見があるが、制約があるからこそ考える必要が生じ、考えることがシミュレーションゲームの楽しさではないのか。 また、兵種変更によりプレイヤーの状況に無限のパターンが生まれ、これらに対してバランス調整をすることなど不可能であるから、実質的にバランス調整を放棄したとしか考えられない。 昔、考え抜いてクリアしたマップが兵種変更で簡単にクリアできてしまう。そもそも、前提となるマップやパラメーターの設定は兵種が変更できないことを前提に調整されているのであるのだから、そのまま使って上手くいくわけがない。 原作の作りこまれたシミュレーションというイメージは消え失せてしまった。 また、アイテム交換で操作をミスるとキャンセルできないというSFC版でもなかった悪質な仕様であり、きずぐすりと間違えて別のアイテムを受け取ってしまうと初めからやり直しになってしまう。 全般的に何かイマイチ。素材は不朽の名作であるため非常にもったいないと感じる。これならUIだけ向上させて他はいじらなければ良かった。,neutral,ja

"We just stayed here for four nights. Sadly, they no longer have a pool on the roof. If you check out the Trip Advisor reviews, you'll find that some of them mention the smell of mold in some rooms, and other reviews are absolutely stellar. Unfortunately, we got a really odd smelling room on the 21st floor (2107, I think). And we had to yank really hard on the door to get it to close.\n\nMy BF brought this up to the front desk, and they said they'd look into it, which reads, \""we'll do nothing\"". We wanted to have some people over but the room just smelled too damn weird and so that never happened.

"Caribou Coffee and Krispy Kreme are merged in this establishment and it doesn't get any better. I have been coming to this location for about three years and this was THE place that turned me on to coffee and donuts. Both of which I never liked before. They use real chocolate in their drinks and have a nice little variety of delicious tea and tea latte fusions! I can't describe their coffee, but it's some of the best, especially their iced espresso. The best. The relaxed decor and atmosphere with the free wi-fi makes it the best little secret by Anthem/7Hills. They are open till 10 which makes this a nice place to work on your lap top in peace.This location is also well kept. There's even a nice little ledge with a rail for the kids to watch the donut making process through the glass and a little chalk board for them to draw on.\n\nIt's true, there is an offer of a free donut with every purchase during their hotlight hours which is something like three times a day. They also have seasonal donut varieties which gives me something new to look forward to, I've even gone so far as sent someone out to get me their latest addition when I didn't have the time. But that isn't something that I would prefer to do because going to Krispy Kreme is a trip to see familiar faces, the staff always remembers me, even whichever drink I've been hung up on lately.",positive,en

"Just completed my annual getaway to Las Vegas, which always includes a pilgrimage to the dirty strip mall off Sahara for dinner at Lotus of Siam. It still reigns as the best Thai food I've ever eaten. They've renovated and expanded the dining space in the last year, and it looks much nicer. The decor is finally being elevated a little closer to the high quality of the food. Surprisingly, I didn't think my meal was as exceptional as my last visit in September 2009. It was still super yummy, but didn't have the same wow factor. Is it the remodel? Larger dining room? Or have I put Lotus of Siam so high on a pedestal from my last experience, it will never be as insanely satisfying as my first dinner there? Wine flights are no longer offered either.",neutral,en
"Stayed here just over a week ago for 4 nights with my partner. Perfect location in the Lower East Side. Had a very stylish corner room witha steam shower, the size of the room itself was a real surprise - it was big! And the bed was by far the best bed we have had in any hotel. HUGE and soo comfortable.
The room had an Ipod dock for the alarm clock which was a great touch, and one of the best mini bars I have seen. They even breing you fresh cookies with the turn down service each night. Lots of great little touches make this one of the better hotels we have stayed in.
Walking distance to very cool bars and restaurants. No problem at all with the reception being on the second floor.
Only negative is that the check in time is not until 4pm - which is pretty late. Our room wasn't ready until 4:20 - but it was worth the wait. Reception staff weren't amazingly friendly, but they helped us with everything we needed when asked.

"鮫映画では秀逸な方だよね
鮫映画にはＺ級と言われる作品がたっくさんある中、この作品はまともな映画だといえると思います。 役者がみんないい。 鮫がちゃんとしている。まあ、種類とか考えるともっと深海っぽくしてほしいという希望はあるけど。 最初に人を襲うシーンで思わず感動してしまいました。 襲う時の鮫の出てくる方向や迫力、そして大きさなどリアルを感じられたからです。もっとしょぼいのを散々見てきたので。 これだよね、鮫が飛ぶならこうじゃないとね！と思わず拳を握りしめて喜んでました。 シーンに工夫が見られるのも、素晴らしい。 鮫映画の工夫のないカメラワークに「もっと工夫を」と思っている身としては、まともな映画ってこうだよねと。この部分にも感動でした。 ストーリー的には家族経営のワニレストランが鮫とトラブり鮫と対峙していくというもので、パニック物モンスター物ではよくあるもの。 キャラ設定が展開に合わせた強引なものだったりしますが、役者が見れる演技をしてくれるんであんまり私は気になりませんでした。 悪役の保安官が女にも金にも汚いという、昔の日本の時代劇の悪代官みたいな設定。 女主人公を職権を利用して関係を迫るとかやってます。最初っからワル全開です。 倫理観もないし狡猾だし、さっさと鮫にやられちまえと思う役どころとなってますね。 重苦しい作風でもないので、気軽に観る作品としてはいいんじゃないかなと思います。",positive,ja

"My wife and I stayed here on a Saturday night. We got a great deal on our room through an online site.
The room was very clean.
I disagree with what other reviewers wrote about the location being convienent. If you are going into NYC for the theater, the hotel is a considerable walk from the theater district. There are other hotels that are a comparable value closer to Times Square.
I agree with what the previous reviewer wrote about the mini bar prices. I know this is a Hilton, but $7.75 for a beer from the mini bar? Are they kidding? I know that there is going to be a markup on liquor, but lets be reasonable. There is liquor store on 54th street between 5th and 6th. Additionally there is a small deli about 2 blocks up on 6th or try the grocer on the east side of the street.
We stayed on the 6th floor and the ice machine did not work. If you are staying at a Hilton, you should not have to go from floor to floor to find a working ice machine.
We also had a problem with the door card not working. We had to go down to the front desk and get new ones made up.
We got a good deal here. We got more than what we paid for. However, this is a hotel that bills itself as a 4 star hotel. If I were paying $300 or $400 per night, these items would have been unacceptable.",negative,en

"This program is certainly my favorite non-sitcom television comedy. Australia produces very little good programs - most of the TV which I watch (and I live in Australia) is from the US and England.The funniest part of this show is just how controversial it is. Like when they went past numerous security barriers at the APEC summit pretending to be Canadian diplomats.The show is made up of pre-filmed stunts, general satirical discussion of current world events, and sometimes on-stage skits. These all come together to make a fabulous, extremely funny TV show. The segments like ""Ad Road-test"" and ""Message from Osama bin Ladin"" are hilarious. For anyone interested in watching hilarious satirical TV comedy - then this is definitely the show you should watch.All the guys are great and do an excellent job in entertaining you for half an hour.I would rate it 10/10.",positive,en

"I stayed here for a convention, and the hotel was very new and pristine. We had a very discounted rate so that helped. Parking was pricey - $25/day, but I do know that it could be worse in San Diego. The Hard Rock charges $35/day. The room was very clean, and simple, no major frills. Housekeeping was great and accommodating. We were given a room that had a HORRIBLE view, that was the only downfall. We got to look at the top of the lower part of the hotel. We did get to see to Coronado Bride, but a better view would have made us feel like we were really in San Diego instead of in a manufacturing area of some kind. The parking staff was also very rude because we didn't valet. We were told we were only given 10 minutes to check in and then we had to move our car immediately. The gal at the front desk who also checked us in was not friendly either. The plus is the Fox Sports Grill and the Spa at this hotel. I got the best massage I have ever received at the Spa, and I was able to use the coupon I got when I checked in. We also really enjoyed the Fox Sports Grille, especially my husband. Reasonable prices, good food, connected to the hotel so not far at all, and it didn't seem like your standard hotel restaurant because it is it's own chain which was nice. The bridge that just opened to connect to Petco Park was VERY handy, and it made it very simple to get over to the Gaslamp Quarter as well.",positive,en

We also had a note pushed through our door to inform us that the water would be off for approximately 8 hours 10pm-6am due to some emergency repair....... next morning arrived NO HOT WATER!..... when we contacted reception we were duely informed that this would be back on in 30 mins...... 30 mins been and gone still no hot water this carried on with numerous frustrating telephone calls to which the staff were just so ""matter of fact"" about the situation they obviously expected their residents just to wash in COLD water and forget about showering..... just the right thing to set you up for a long day out sighseeing!....... On our third day we had a leak from the room upstairs when we called concierge to check this out they sent a handyman who had taken a look at it... he then went upstairs to check the room directly above us returned some 15 mins later said that it would be ok and that the resident upstairs had left the bath running!..... to this day nothing was ever done about our room and anyone staying there will see for themselves room 1202!.....

"This is a very special hotel. Very exclusive but cozy at the same time. The design of everything – rooms, lobby, entrance, even our meeting room was so extraordinary original and beautiful that staying here made extreme pleasure. You feel luxury and attention to detail in everything, yet without any arrogance.
Food was great and beautifully presented. Pictures hanging in the restaurant make very upscale and warm atmosphere that it feels good to start a day with a breakfast there.
Entrance to hotel is small but very luxurious. Room decorated amazingly, apparently with every detail taken care of, including inside the bathroom.
Reception: fast, efficient, helpful and extremely friendly and with sense of humor.
Location not bad as it is very close to a great shopping center.
This is probably one of the most beautiful hotels I ever stayed. I did not want to leave it.

"Two words describe our experience: annoying and disappointing. Let me elaborate.
On the evening of Saturday 27th, our first night there, one of the guests on the 25th floor had two male visitors who were conducting an extraordinarily loud and rude conversation in the hallway that startled us out of a deep sleep. We called management to complain but as no one came up to handle the matter, I eventually had to get up and step into the hallway where I politely asked that the two guys keep it down. At that point they mocked my request so I closed the door and again called the front desk. Prior to security finally appearing, the two males apparently left but not before one last insult at our door of ‘stupid queers’ followed by derisive laughter. Not a great tone for sleep. Encountering belligerent and potentially dangerous drunken outsiders in the hallway where I’m spending over $300 per night is annoying. The too late appearance of your security was disappointing.
Adding insult to injury, the next morning's overpriced, tasteless and cold egg omelet breakfast was perhaps the worst hotel meal we've ever had.
This hotel may be perfect for the uninitiated traveler or the nightlife crowd, but, based on my experiences here, I doubt that we will ever stay with this hotel chain again.",negative,en

"We stayed at this hotel a few years ago when it was the Rihga Royal. Back then rooms were warm with beautiful fabrics and amazing cherry or mahogany wood bathrooms that were fitting for the Queen. We were shocked to walk into an ugly fake wood floor in the living area with the ugliest purple HARD couch and cold decor. The bedroom area was better, but the bathroom was gutted and now all while marble like tiles - everywhere. The tub is gone and now an awkward long shower with shower heads at each end - kinda weird. I am sure those who like modern will enjoy it, but I found it cold and not cozy at all. Now - the service was fine! Check in was a breeze. We requested to check in an hour early - and actually showed up 2 hours early - and got our room immediately. We did have room service and that was very prompt - although 17% tip and 5.00 service charge is included, they still are looking for more. We did use the valet parking and that was perfect!

今回はえらく評価が低いな、と思いつつ読了したが、やはり評価の原因は作画か……。 私は他の異世界もののレビューで何度も言っていることだが、異世界転生ものには動きのある絵を描ける作者が極端に少ない。イラストだけで漫画の勉強をしていないことが多く、それでも群雄割拠の異世界転生界隈では見た目の華やかさが何よりも優先されるからだ。女の子の絵が可愛ければ戦闘やモンスター、背景が描けなくても良い。そんな風潮がある。そもそも異世界転生もの界隈自体が粗製乱造なためある意味仕方ないとはいえるが、商業作品として読者から代金を貰い販売している以上、""描けない""は論外。今まではちゃんとした戦闘シーンが無かったため油断していたが、このまま5巻に続くようであれば読者を舐めている、バカにしていると取られても仕方ない。キャラ自体は本当に可愛く描けており、魅力的であるからこそ、この出来は勿体ないと言わざるを得ず、他の低評価レビューもそのジレンマに苦しんでいるのだろう。続刊で少しでも改善が見られるよう祈りたい。",negative,ja

"I honestly thought this place was just okay. I wasn't overly impressed with anything I tried...maybe I ordered the wrong things?\n\nEdamame--It was okay but it was stuffed in a bowl that was too small so the salt was only on the top two or three pieces. When we asked for more salt we were offered a salt shaker that had large crystalized salt in it, so..... the salt wouldn't come out. There were several pieces that did not have the beans in them at all. \n\nThe house salad with ginger dressing was very good. \n\nThe sushi combinations were just okay. Anything we ordered with spicy tuna was pretty good and seemed fresh. The salmon was just so-so and the yellowtail was very fishy. I was told by one of my dining partners that the lobster roll was very good. I think I was a little disappointed because even the rolls that offered \""crunch\"" had no crunch at all. So, the consistency was a bit bothersome. I also didn't think the pieces were very big for the price. \n\nThe atmosphere was okay, nothing special. The service was decent but we had to wait quite awhile and there was no one in the restaurant. \n\nBottom line..I was expecting MUCH more from this place due to all the fabulous reviews. I wouldn't go back. I like Room 112 or Osaka or cowfish better.",negative,en

"Despite later claims, this early-talkie melodrama has very little in common with ""Citizen Kane"": It's a biopic of a ruthless but human fictional plutocrat, told in flashback but hopping around time. The scriptwriter, Preston Sturges, shows none of his later gift for sparkling dialog, and none of the myriad cinematic innovations of ""Kane"" are evident. Still, it's very watchable, with a young Spencer Tracy (his old-man makeup makes him look just like, well, an old Spencer Tracy) showing depth and authority, and Colleen Moore -- a little past her prime, and not physically well matched -- playing a multifaceted woman-behind-the-man. There's also Helen Vinson as one of the most treacherous femmes fatales in movie history, sending the final third into ecstatic soap-opera reverberations. The surviving print is jumpy and has missing audio snippets, and there are some plot holes left open (how would she know whose son it was if she's sleeping with both of them?), and the music is awfully hokey. For all that, I was quite fascinated.",positive,en

So we are in this awesome suite with views of the Chrysler building the room is spotless and everything is very up-to-date still vintage and ornate but at least up to date and to our standards so then I am giving this hotel five stars !

"La narration, scindée en cinq parties (quatre chapitres et un épilogue), est aussi fluide qu’ingénieusement sinueuse. La réalisation oscille entre une certaine simplicité et une exceptionnelle rigueur. Le cadrage de chaque plan est découpé de manière à atteindre une symétrie parfaite et étudiée, notamment par l’utilisation récurrente du split-screen. Par ce parti-pris de réalisation un peu frontal, Jaime Rosales empêche le spectateur de s’imprégner des lieux, et le privant du repère de lieu, l’oblige à se focaliser sur la solitude que ‘partagent’ chacun des personnages, et l’autorise à s’imprégner uniquement du malaise que provoque cette solitude collective, pour mieux l’y confronter. Et en évitant le piège du sentimentalisme naïf que tend le genre du film choral, en s’entourant d’interprètes au charme frais, naturels et pour la plupart inconnus, il fait de son film LA SOLEDAD une œuvre puissante, sincère, salvatrice et d’une maîtrise transcendante, dignement récompensée en 2008 par les Goya de meilleur film et de meilleur réalisateur, après avoir eu l’honneur d’une présentation à Cannes en 2007 dans la section Un Certain Regard.",positive,fr

If you want to see an independent documentary about Gallipoli, without bias towards any one side (the only enemy in these events was the War itself) then you'll come away both impressed and sobered.

"I find that it's important to see the price differences between different shows before being too constructive in my reviews. According to Cirque du Soleil Las Vegas, these are the prices that I got for 2015 (cheapest - most expensive). I want to compare these 4 shows only because they have similar whimsical approach, family-friendly and kids-friendly. \nNOTE: Keep in mind that there are ALWAYS offers at the box office and their website. You can also purchase tickets at the Half Price Show Tickets booths everywhere on the strip.\n\n* Mystere (Treasure Island): starting at $85 for regular price (Category 3) to $119 for regular price (Category 1).\n\n* KA show (MGM): starting at $99 for regular price (Category E) to $150 regular price (Category B).\n\n* Zarkana (Aria): starting at $99 for regular price (Category D) to $155 for regular price (Category B).\n\n* \""O\"" (Bellagio): starting at $109 for regular price (Category D) to $155 for regular price (Category B). There are options to purchase VIP Suite Seating but only sell for party of 2 or 4. \n\n(Check out my reviews for other three shows if you are interested.)\n_____________________________________________\n\nZarkana is the youngest acrobatic show out of these 4 shows. Aria is one of the newest casino hotel on the strip, so having Zarkana featured here definitely attracted more traffics to this hotel. \n\nAbout the actual show, in term of the stage transformation and links between acts, it was not smooth and I believe a lot of previous comments already mentioned that! If we look at the regular pricing, this show has the third most expensive price. It is almost as expensive as buying ticket to see the \""O\"" show which I believe to be the best of the best! I bought my ticket at Half Price Show Tickets for seats on the right side of the orchestra. Still, I was pretty closed to the stage. Then, I wished I only paid for the cheapest seats cos the theater is relatively small comparing to other shows. The sad part was that there were loads of seats opened everywhere in the theater... \n\nOne cool thing - you can take photo but without flash! You can also bring in drinks as not as it is not in a glass. You will have to switch to a plastic cup at the front gates of the theater. \n\nOverall, I love watching Cirque de Soleil because I do enjoy experiencing their acrobatic and musical talents, and efforts in stage decorations. If you have never experienced Cirque de Soleil before and don't mind much about the different prices, save your money for the \""O\"" Show. If you are like me, watch all other three before watching Zarkana, don't have your high hopes up because the best thing you may find would be sand drawings in the show. #spoilalerts!",negative,en

"Since Sakana has me sushi smitten I decided to give this place a try. I went here for lunch on Saturday and I was the only customer there the entire time. Thank God there was a TV I would've been annoyed if I had to make small talk the entire time. The waitress and the Sushi chef were very friendly and accommodating- I actually got way more food than I could've imagined. I ordered the Mountain Roll for $13.75 and a Side Salad for $2.75. The waitress also gave me miso soup, watermelon and edamame- Needless to say I was stuffed! The Mountain Roll couldn't not satisfy my sushi craving (it was basically a California roll topped with tuna and salmon dressed in some spicy sauce). I'm not a big fan of California rolls anyways but this was definitely on par with a grocery store so I'm glad it was topped! The sauce made it a little hard to differentiate between the Tuna and the Salmon. I will give this place another try because they are friendly and cheap but I'm not going to get the Mountain Roll again.",negative,en

"Hines and Goforth, the perpetrators of this crime, begin on the wrong foot first step, by assuming that Wells wrote Gothic horror and that all of his lines are meant to be taken seriously. That simply isn't true. Wells was very much an inheritor of the Enlightenment, and his main concern was that Victorian self-satisfaction might leave the British unprepared for the world the new technology could produce - both the good and the bad.Two terrible consequences follow - the protagonist is portrayed as a wimpy screamer (I was reminded of Fay Wray in the original King Kong), rather than a man struggling to live out the ironies of an unbelievable catastrophe; and the dialog reeks of 'Victorianisms' uttered seriously that Welles clearly meant to be taken tongue in cheek.All of this looks suspiciously like Ed Wood with an enormous budget to waste on CGI effects - which by the way are so poorly accomplished, the Warner Bros. cartoon factory of the 1940s could have done a better job. (Gobs of spattered blood looked like red balloons, I expected them to float away any minute.) Think The Yellow Submarine as done by the old EC Comics.Worse yet is the loss of theme, which robs the film of any reason to exist. Although the makers of this film return the story to its Victorian era, they utterly miss the uncanny way Wells' story predicted many of the horrors of the First World War - a fact not unnoticed by Wells himself, who, after the war, reworked the theme in The Shape of Things to Come.Without any theme, all we have here are a lot of people running around getting blasted into cartoon balloons, when they're not trying out for a high school production of a drunken student's rewrite of Macbeth.Really, this is the worst, most senseless piece of drivel I have suffered through since a friend talked me into seeing the Eastern European cartoon ""Fantastic Planet"" thirty years ago. That film was so pretentiously dull, my friend and I and two total strangers gave up ridiculing it about half-way through, and sat near the screen playing cards, using the movie as light by which to see the cards - its only usefulness, as far as any of us could tell.But I already have electric lighting in my apartment, so I didn't need this put-down of Wells for anything.Do not avoid this film - steal every copy you can (don't pay a cent) and burn each and every one of them. God in his wisdom created us just for this purpose.",negative,en

We were given the choice to have a room on a higer floor (so we could enjoy the view) and what a spectacular view!. We've stayed in very nice hotels and this hotel was all that and more - excellent housekeeping, exceptional service and the most comfortable bed which only made us want to return early every day. Everything we wanted to visit was within a short walking distance or only a short taxi ride. We were absolutely staying in the heart of the city!
We lived in San Francisco in 1969 and were on a limited budget but have such wonderful memories of our time spent there. We always dreamed of the day when we could return to this fine city and stay in one of its nicest places. I think we chose well.

"the villas are pricey but offer all ammenties of a 5star hotel. with a party of 4 or more it will definitely pay back at the end. fully equipped kitchen comes with detergent and other basics to start with. the whole place was sooo clean and welcoming, had a large balcony, a luxurious bathroom, two sinks and the sleeper sofa was of top quality. this must be a marriott. when we arrived monday evening the toilet drain clogged up, but was fixed within 30min. the villas offer 2pools with waterfalls and misters for some sunbeds, 2 jacuzzis and a kiddie pool. mainpool offers volleyball- and basketball section. table tennis, table soccer and other (table-) games offered on grounds. BBQ sections available troughout the resort. this place is large and walking from the outer villas to the pools may take 10min or so. however staying close to the pools may cause disturbance at night as they open until 11pm and kids may shout and scream around late. it's a family place at the end :-) the villas offer shuttle service to nearby desert ridge marketplace, a huge upscale openair mall and to the jw desert ridge resort and spa, where all ammenties can be used for villa guests. as the villa pools can get crowded fast, the pools at the jw can be a great alternative. don't miss the cocktail and appetizer(sushi) happy hour at roy's at usd6 each, a real treat. the best pizza in the world is served at tuscany's (""signature-pizza""), both at the jw. visited various places in the area, this remains our favourite. without kids however the jw is the better option. enjoy.",positive,en
"This review is strictly in regards to the Roof deck/Pool. Although it would be cool to stay here, to see how it stacks up the W I stayed at in NYC, but, I only came for the party. \n\nFirst of all, our friends told us it would be \""No problem getting in\"" - PFFFFFFFFFFFFT. Wrong. The bouncers we in full douchmode, and we ended up having to wait a good 15 minutes until our party inside came to retrieve us.. I was with some ridiculously good looking people too, and these m-f-ers weren't having it. In fact, at one point I asked if it was a damn gay bar because of the amount of dudes they were letting in before us. Dick to chick ratio was really off. To make things more annoying, they decided to have yet ANOTHER set of ropes and bouncers waiting for you to get up the stairs. So again. More fucking waiting. Why they do this, I have no clue, but its retarded.\n\nOnce we finally got upstairs, we were bombarded with your typical Scottsdale crowd.. Dudes grabbing at you, girls calling you a f-ing c*** and queening out for slightly bumping into them, silicone, blonde's, bros, steroids, oompa-loompa skin tones.. etc. It just reminded me why, it is, that I really dislike hanging out there. Dressing like a stripper is not my thing, so I felt a little out of place, but whatever... my Betsy Johnson dress was just fine. The only bar that accepts credit/debit is the one next to the entrance, so if you only have plastic, enjoy waiting another 15 minutes for a weak gin & tonic. The other bars up there are cash only, so be prepared. \n\nThe pool is pretty cool, equipped with windows on the bottom so people can see the action from below, and vice versa. Lots of cabanas and shit to sit on.. wouldn't mind taking a dip here someday, but its not exactly on top of my list. \n\nI think we stayed for a whopping 30 minutes before escaping to a real bar. Although some of you may really be into this trendy type scene, it's not exactly my cup of tea. The venue itself is pretty sweet, its just the crowd that isn't doing it for me. I also hate waiting. For anything.. blame it on impatience if you will, but at 11:30pm on Saturday, I want to drink.. not sit around waiting and watching people slide in ahead.",negative,en

テーマは「余白」ですよね？ しかし、中身は余白が中心の本とは言い難い。 普通のデザイン解説集と変わりません。 数ページ読んだところで呆れ果ててしまいました。 【問題点】 ・タイトルと異なり実際の中身は余白デザインの内容が中心にはなっていない。 ・余白以外のフォント・カラー・装飾などの解説で中身が相当程度埋められている。 ・""NG作例""と""OK作例""では、余白以外のフォント・カラー・装飾なども含めてほぼ全て 変わってしまっているので、余白の効果や意義がわかりにくくなっている。 あらゆる要素が変化しすぎているので、どこが余白中心の本なのか、と苦笑いするしかありません。 ・各デザイン事例が利用されるであろうシチュエーションに応じた画像背景が置かれている。 (例えば料理店のメニューのデザインの背景にパンやコーヒーがのっているテーブルの背景が 置かれているという具合だ。) このことが事前に説明されておらず、どこからどこまでが デザイン事例なのかがわかるまで最初はとまどう。よかれと思って加えた工夫が説明もなくいきなり 表示されているので読み手に強烈な認知負荷を与えている。 【良い点】 ・余白に特化したデザイン書籍というコンセプトのみ (ただし、中身は全く伴ってません) ・余白ではなく普通のデザイン解説本としては優良 【まとめ】 ・余白に特化した書籍と思わせて、その実、万人向け狙いになってしまったのでしょうか、 余白以外の説明のほうが多いような構成になっており、タイトルを見て買った読者の期待を見事に裏切る本です。 ・余白以外のデザイン要素を極力変えず改善案を示さなければ、余白の真の効力は見えてきません。 そういう意味では、何がやりたいのか全くわからない書籍になってます。 余白の本を銘打ったからには、余白による変化をもっと中心軸に据えた構成にすべきです。 ・デザインがほとんどわからない読者やデザインの基礎を学習してきてない読者に とってはおもしろい本にみえるかもしれませんが、結局、読んだ後に余白について明確に 得られるものは少なく、全体像もわからないままでしょう。 ・デザインをまじめに学習する気が無い方か、 デザインをある程度やってきたが余白を含めたデザイン事例や解説で再確認したい方、 これら両極にある読者が学習半分・娯楽半分として読む本だと思います。",negative,ja

"Wow, what a downer for my only chance to eat out in Phoenix. Here on business with many colleagues, the choice was made to eat at Alexi's since it was an extremely short drive to the hotel where we were staying. Our party consisted of 8 adults who were all extremely hungry and ready to place our orders after waiting for a table for a short period of time..not more than 15 minutes. \nFor a Monday night, I must say that the place was pretty packed. The server was a very kind, sweet man who came across as quick, but lagged terribly with everything. I am thinking it could have well been the delay inside the kitchen--not him...as again, he was pretty efficient.\nWe ordered some appetizers of caprese = good, and fried calamari = ok. Their bread that they provide = okay--nothing extraordinary.\nMost of us were ready to order quite quickly, but the food just took absolutely forever. We probably started eating our food around 8:30pm, after being there for more than an hour munching on our appetizers which were devoured in seconds and sipping on our beverages.\nThe food all in all, everyone said was mediocre and regretted what they ordered. The steak was dry, my colleague said, the sauce was too heavy and drowning the food, another said, and so on... One colleague left her nearly full plate behind and said that the taste was off from what she was expecting. I ordered the chicken marsala which was really good actually, but just way too much sauce...You couldn't even taste the chicken--just sauce!\nFor a hungry bunch of out-of-towners, Alexi's was certainly nothing special. I probably wouldn't recommend this place to anyone coming to downtown Phoenix...business or pleasure.

Which they weren't serving when we arrived...\n\nThere was a wait of about 20-30 minutes, so we sampled their beers while we waited. \nThe AMBER beer: A strong hoppy taste, bitter notes on the finish. Not our favorite.\nThe WEISS: Favorite! :} I'm always a fan of wheat/hefeweisen style beers, and this one was the best of their selection. Smooth, crisp with citrus notes and a pleasant overall finish. Served with a wedge of lemon. Best of the lot, but not anything worth going crazy over. \nThe STOUT: Forgettable. Dark beer, but not particularly distinquished. \n\n+ For making their beer on site.\n+ For big, tall, ice-cold glasses of beer being $1.75\n\nWhen we finally got into the restaurant, we had our disappointment over the BBQ and then carried on. We started with their fish n' chips. Supposed to be one of their signature dishes, since way back in the day. The fish had a nice, greasy beer batter and good flakiness on the inside. Comparable to anything you'd get at a Fish n' chipery in London? Definitely not. Still very edible, though. And the fact that it's served with malt vinegar, on a tray with newspaper, is cute and I appreciated that. \n\nAfter that came our main orders;\n\nSalads first! Iceberg lettuce drenched in dressing. 2 smallish tomatoes each, tons of croutons. Meh, Bleucheese makes any salad edible, but not noteworthy. Came with stale looking buns. \n\nSteak & shrimp: A surf n' turf. The steak was thin, gristly and overcooked. The shrimp were battered and fried to oblivion- burnt on the outside and were gross on the inside. The potatoes were most likely instant.\n\nRib eye special: Huge slab of pink, tender juicy meat. Baked potato looked over-cooked and wrinkly. We still haven't touched it, days later, despite our best intentions otherwise.\n\nThe food was ok, but the only thing we'll go back for is to try the BBQ or karaoke and drink up some cheap beer. \n\nThough it was entertaining being seated next to the creepy old perverted couple, who talked dirty throughout most of the meal. Sleazy old style Vegas for you, I suppose.",negative,en

"I booked this Embassy for just one night. It has a good, central location in north Dallas.
The main reason I have given this hotel only two stars is that it is messy. There was a persistent odor inside the hotel. The floors were dirty and the walls, floors, ceilings...just about everything is starting to show its age and is getting rough around the edges.
I don't know what it is about Embassy's lately, but Hilton really needs to upgrade/repair/replace the elevators. They are slow and sometimes seem to have a mind of their own.
Our room was fairly clean for the most part except for a foot long piece of toilet paper hanging from one of the fire sprinkler heads (I can't figure that one out except that maybe the housekeeper used toilet paper to clean it with and left it hanging up there in a rush). Also, there was a section of the ceiling that was missing. It was about 1' x 2' and had a green wire hanging out. It appeared that there was supposed to be a metal plate covering it. Very odd.
The beds were clean, but the floor was not. But since we arrived fairly late at night, we just went to bed. The shower was very nice with alot of water pressure and plenty of heat.
The afternoon managers reception was one of the weakest I've been to. Very slow and the food was of poor quality in my opinion. As a result, we decided to skip breakfast the next morning.
As with most Embassy's I've been to, the service and employees were great. Always had a smile and were wanting to make our stay better. Unfortunately, they didn't have alot to work with at this location.",negative,en

"We ate here in July and although I am a fan of the food-I think this place runs a bit of a scam...\n\nFrom what I can tell, they basically sell wine, although they claim to have someone run down the street or what have you. So you pay them and tip them but no real running down the street ever happens. I bet they have boxes of it back there. That said, it's still probably cheaper than buying it.\n\nThe service here I would describe as mixed. We went on a night when it was DEAD. It was just us and a few other people finishing up. It was a Weds and it must have been about 9pm when we were seated.\n\nI can't recall our servers name after all that time, but he was a bit of a know it all. If you get this guy you will know it...he will basically \""suggest\"" this and that...but these aren't suggestions, he will probably poison you if you don't follow them. I am only half joking. He \""suggested\"" only the most expensive stuff on the menu-but for me it was all good. It was a great meal with a good friend I rarely see, but it was a little intimidating. I actually think this guy deserves a good beating...god knows how many people he has done this to. The pastas, the apps and the entrees were all, for me, solid to excellent. If it was just on the food I would give them 5 stars, but the guy was a total ass...and I wouldn't eat here again. I would rather eat at an ok restaurant (food wise) with great service than the opposite. Our check was pretty steap, which is ok and we tipped Mr. recommendation well, but I can't endorse the place because of this. Don't get me wrong-it was good enough to overlook the service as long as you can ensure you don't get this guy. I don't know how to do that though, and I don't like being strong armed by anyone...least of all by some guy who brings me my food and is supposed to let ME decide. Capiche?",negative,en

My girlfriend and I walk in around 2:00 on Saturday and I was expecting a litrle bit of a wait but this was just stupid.

After about 20 minutes I notice a man is talking to the hostess about he and his family of 5 are still waiting to be seated and have ben skipped over by multiple parties. The hostess says she doesnt have his name on the computer but he is obviously holding a pager and had been waiting for awhile. The hostess. Had a couple more complainta of people waiting from people being skipped and just as I was getting impatient my girlfried went up and asked if the same problem had happeded to us and it had. My biggest problem with this isnt the computer its that the hostess has eyes and if she bothered to take a look around she would see that the same people are still standing in front of her while she continues to call other names. I waited almost half an hour for what was supposed to be 10 minutes. Thats why I rated this place the way I did. The foods good. The place is busy. Ther servers are nice.

"Having had satisfactory service from Carphone Warehouse in the past, I am disappointed to say that I have lost trust in the company, having been falsely advertised on their website.
I decided to upgrade to a new monthly contract with EE, having seen a 'fantastic' deal online for a 12 month contract with a new phone. Having double checked that it was in fact a 12 month contract and not the usual 24 months, I proceeded to order the phone, but when it arrived it stated it was in fact 24 months and not 12 months. Stupidly, I did not take a screenshot of the online deal, having trusted them in the past.
I called up and used the online chat and to my surprise, they all stated there is no such thing as '12 month contracts' when clearly they advertise it on all media which was just bizarre. I asked them to check their website and they just did not care, no apology at all.
Hence, I returned the phone and have decided to now not use them again. If you are interested in 12-month contracts, please proceed with caution and take screenshots, or alternatively do what I will do and now proceed with sim only deals, elsewhere!",negative,en

The food itself was delicious, tender and fresh ingredients were used. \n\nThe ambiance itself left something to be desired as the 'top hits of today' rang through the speakers.

It's a good place to hang out for awhile.

While they were good, they just didn't jump out at you.

Trader Joe's is one of those places that you either like or dislike intensely. This is one of my favorite TJ locations and it is both close to my car dealer and not to far from the house.\n\nNormally pop in here after getting my car serviced at Honda. I usually drive the back way and behind the dealership and use the traffic signal right on TJ's corner.\n\nEach store is set up a little differently and some are bigger than others. I'm always surprised at how many people are at this location shopping. Then again there are several other stores in the same parking lot which makes this a convenient visit.\n\nSome of our favorite items here are the Orange Chicken in the freezer section. The bagged freezed Dried Fruits are also a big time score and my Granddaughter definitely has most of the collection. Even picked up some Jackfruit on my last visit.\n\nThe one thing that makes TJ's a fun place to shop is the Pumpkin products celebration that they have during the fall season. I'm a fool for pumpkin and grabbed several of their 40+ items on my last adventure. Easy to make and very tasty.\n\nThe quality of their products here are better than most chain stores and the customer service is always friendly with a bit of pep. You may even hear the happy bell ring in the back ground.\n\nLook for their flyers that come out in the mail and get ready for some really cool specials. FEELING LIKE A FOOL!\n\n3.75 STARS,neutral,en

"Great price, far enough off from Fremont Street that the Fremont Experience doesn't keep you awake but is a quick block and a half away, Market Street Cafe is a great value. Clean, adequate-sized rooms and comfortable beds. Gaming tables are reasonably priced. If you want to goback and forth to the strip without paying too much for taxis, take the double deck er 24 hour bus back and forth for $8 a day. Definitely a hang out for Hawiians as noted by others - pleasant, but almost sedate crowd compared to what is happening two blocks over. Also, none of those peskt \""resort fees\"" the hotels are adding for maintaining a swimmng pool and expected amenities. You have to watch out for those resort fees as they are only listed in the fine print at websites like Vegas.com and it stings when they surprise you with them at check-in.\n\nLike all downtown hotels, this is not a strip hotel nor anything close to one. Staying downtown to save money and fnd pleasure in an alternative Vegas to the increatingly pretentious strip hotels.. You don't go to these hotels for a resort experience - you go to gamble less expensively, hang out on Fremont Street night (I described it as Hollywood Blvd. on steroids to several of my friends) , and see once we would described as a more \""blue collar\"" Vegas feel. If this is your first trip to Vegas and you are under 40 I would recommend you stay on the strip just for the experience. But if you are like me and don't want to spend at least close to $300 a night on some of the prettier strip hotel rooms compared to something towards $70 or less per night on a Labor Day weekend at the Calfiornia, then give downtown Vegas and its hotels a try.

After finally getting through to their phone line, I have been waiting on the phone for 3 hours for a customer service representative so that I can ask for my refund. I also have been waiting on their live chat for 2 hours, there were 72 people ahead of me in queue. These wait times mean - many many customers are unhappy right now and that Lynx air has maybe 1 employee working in their entire customer service department.

"I know what you're thinking. That can't be possible. Well I would never have thought a hotel (especially a 4-star Westin) would act in such a sleazy manner, but it is 100% true.
I booked my stay over two months in advance and pre-paid my reservation. I received a reservation and a confirmation number from the hotel. Then, two days before my arrival when I called the hotel as a courtesy to inform them I would be arriving late, they said my reservation was cancelled. When I pressed for how this could happen, I was told that the hotel was overbooked and there was nothing they could do to accomodate me. Making matters even worse is the fact that the hotel did not even call me to let me know they cancelled me. They were perfectly content to let me fly six hours to San Francisco and arrive at midnight only to then tell me I had no place to stay.
It is painfully obvious that they cancelled my reservation because I was at a less expensive rate (since I booked two months early) than what they could get from someone else booking last-minute. I am still in shock by their actions and by there total disregard of customer service, including their refusal to do anything to accomodate me (such as finding a room in a nearby hotel). Beware if you book with Westin...you might not have a room when you show up!",negative,en

"I stayed at Ocean Park Inn while in San Diego for work, and at first booked because of the location- I was looking forward to being near the beach, and most of my co-workers live in La Jolla. Being right on the beach was fantastic, and the hotel is walking distance to everything- from good restaurants (check out Taco Tuesdays at Fat Fish or World Famous for a nice dinner) as well as bars (I didn't go to any, but there are a ton in the area) and I loved the little market area along the boardwalk that had San Diego memoriabilia. I was looking for a place where I could relax after work and found it in this hotel- while the rooms are a bit dated, the beds are comfy, the tv had tons of channels (something I took for granted until a recent stay in a different city), and the balcony had a table and two chairs that was just perfect for taking in the ocean breeze. The AC unit is a little noisy, so during the day I would leave it on high so I could turn it off at night. Sleeping with the balcony door open is nice too- it was cool at night while I was there. The staff was beyond helpful- they provided me with coupons to various restaurants and were great in helping me with directions. One staff member in particular went above and beyond what was required of him. Sachin worked the night shift and is honestly the reason that I would return- I travel frequently for my job and have to say that his hospitality is the best I have ever received- I find that hotel staffs are usually polite, but don't go that extra mile. From giving me not just silverware when my to-go food didn't have any but also extra packets of salt/pepper/red pepper flakes (he was so thoughtful), to trying to fix my suitcase handle which broke (and even calling my room to ask if I would like maintenance to look at it), to letting me use a bottle opener and refusing to take it back (it's now part of my travel bag!) and even carrying my suitcase to my room when I decided last minute to stay at OPI again after staying in LA for two days (my train had unexpected problems and was delayed 2.5 hours so I got there very late and was exhausted-he could tell and was so accommodating). I'll travel to San Diego twice a year going forward and plan on making OPI my go-to hotel.",positive,en

"My husband and I stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn in Tribeca during our most recent trip to NYC in May. We chose this hotel based on reviews, price, and location. It met all of our expectations. This hotel is not fancy (a la Trump Soho), but it's a lovely hotel. The rooms were very nice - new and modern - and spotless. The bed was very comfortable. The room was also very quiet. We didn't hear a thing from the rooms around us or from outside. Amazing for NYC! We slept so well. The one thing that I really noticed at this hotel was the high level of customer service. The staff were all extremely courteous, professional, friendly, and helpful. Every staff member was a true gem. The staff really make you feel welcome and are so happy to help you with whatever you need. The location of the hotel is ideal. The subway is literally outside the front door. Soho shopping is a very short walk (a few minutes) as is Greenwhich Village and fabulous restaurants. Lupa in Greenwhich Village is amazing. We eat there several times each time we go to NYC. We never get sick of it. I highly recommend this hotel if you want a modern, clean, quiet hotel in a great location with really fabulous staff.",positive,en
"I stayed at the Charlotte Westin for 3 nights recently on a business trip.
The hotel is right in the middle of Charlotte adjacent to the Convention center. It is walking distance away from dozens of restaurants and is a full service hotel with room service, an indoor pool, excercise room, and 2 restaurants onsite.
The staff was very friendly, the lobby and public areas immaculate, and the downtown area safe for walking at all hours of the night.
The rooms were spotless. The fit and finish perfect, and the halls and elevators clean.
The bathrooms were clean with bump-out shower curtains and a unique, multi-head shower. The water was always hot. The low flow toilets had the typical low flow toilet problems (if you know what I mean) and I'm a bit puzzeled by placing a wall size mirror directly opposite the toilet (do I need to see myself there?)
The beds that drew raves by other reviewers were not for me. The linens were great, but the pillows were a selection of too tiny, fiberfill ones. I had to continually bunch 3 or 4 of them during the night. And my Queen bed was extra firm - with a high spot in the middle. I kept thinking I was rolling off the end, and my arm kept going to sleep from laying on it.
The TV was great - good reception. The Internet worked well, though like other guests reported it costs $12.95/day -- so $39 for my stay, and it was relatively slow compared with my home 5MB service (which also costs $39, but for a month!).
Noise was an issue. I could hear right through the walls. Every time the toilet next door flushed I woke up. And I felt like I was in the shower with them. Though I was on an upper floor, I was awakened by Police sirens on all 3 nights -- my room overlooked the Interstate Highway. The train tracks i thought might be an issue tuned out to be commuter tracks only and were silent the whole time.
So overall a middle of the road rating. I know there is not much they can do about Police sirens passing by, but I wasn't impressed by the beds, incidental neighbor noise, or the paid Internet service. I expected more for an upscale $300/night+ hotel. An airport shuttle would help, as well, as it was a $25 fixed-fee cab ride each way.

"Barman just wanted to make a movie because he wanted to. Just as simple as that, and he succeeded. Not only in his goal, but also in making a wonderful movie, especially visually. He knows how to use pans, slow-motion sequences, tracking shots, crane shots, etc. in a beautiful, smooth way. This gives the movie a very relaxing feel to it.The story is about the lives of 8 very different characters who have nothing in common except one thing: a party that they all attend to, which also is the turnpoint of this movie. The beauty of this picture lies not in the question how the characters have effect on eachother (in comparance with a similar, of course better movie like Magnolia). I simply don't think that that was Barman's idea. The beauty lies in the different details of experiences that people go through which makes or breaks their lives. Barman is very successful in telling those little stories that describe little experiences. He knows people..... and Antwerp.The soundtrack of the movie is also excellent, but not a surprise as we know that Barman is also a very succesful songwriter and musician with his band dEUS. The music is sometimes hot and at the same time relaxing which contributes to the sunny, smooth feel of the movie. Other times we hear funky pop/rock-melodies which give some scenes the strength that they need.There's only one flaw, and that's the last half an hour. Was it the runtime, which was breaking me up? Or weren't the last scenes that fresh and accurate than the scenes until then? I can't figure it out...All in all a beautiful sunny movie which lifts the Belgian cinema up.8 out of 10!(It's the breeze that flows through a girl's hair on a sunny afternoon making her even more beautiful; it's the fresh breeze that makes you relax when it passes you at a crowded party when someone opens the door; it's the breeze that carries the perfume from that beautiful girl sitting next to you in the park who you just met a week ago; it's the breeze.....)",positive,en

"American Airlines put us up in this hotel after messing up our flight. Stayed one night, with late arrival and early checkout, so spent very little time at the property.
Pros:
Shuttle provided to/from airport.
Friendly and helpful front-desk staff.
Cons:
WiFi did not work; waited on hold for offsite tech support but I gave up before my call was taken.
Air conditioning and refrigerator were loud.
Airport shuttle takes about 10 minutes; not terrible, but for more convenience check out the Hilton located at the airport.",negative,en

southwest is by far my favorite airline. I have traveled to many cities on Southwest. Their employees all seem so happy. \nFrom the pilot to the the ticket agent. This flight was a fun one with lots if people drinking and flying to see UCLA play ASU! The pilot played the Arizona school sing when we landed and the people went nuts. Speaking if nuts. I still live the free nuts and pretzels! Good times! Flying with with SW makes travel easy and enjoyable. And don't forget that everyone can still check one baggage for free,positive,en

The room was average size but with all new furniture etc. It is in a great location for most on business. Room service was prompt and with good food.
My issues involved actually getting a person to help you with anything you might need. When I arrived around 6pm there was one person working a very long check in line. Seemed light for a hotel that large. Later I asked for more towels, nobody showed. There were two crakers on the floor when arrived and they were there when I left. Wonder if they are still there?

"Stayed here for a night on the way back from Hawaii on a very short layover with my family of five. Arrived around 9 and the shuttle service was the best part about the stay. Very convenient, friendly driver and quick ride from airport. Check-in took a while since everyone getting off the shuttle checks in at once.
We reserved a ""family room"" that had a room with two double beds and a connecting room with a king bed, but only one bathroom. Room was a great size but this is an older property and our room was at the very end of a series of hallways and confusing walkways and elevators to reach; I'm guessing one of the older rooms. It had a stale smell and was in need of renovation both in the rooms and bathroom. Bed comforters looked old and dirty.
Went down to the restaurant to eat, since we hadn't eaten dinner and kids were starving. Even though we arrived toward the end of their posted hours you could tell they didn't want to serve us and we were not welcomed warmly. Food was ok. Bar area hopping, but kids not allowed to eat in the bar area.
Shuttle back to airport for early morning flight was again perfect. Would not stay at this hotel again unless it was needed for a very short overnight stay. I'm sure there are better properties in the area.",negative,en

"Located on the quiet 51st St (well, by NY standards) this is an absolute gem of a hotel. I found a special on expedia so otherwise didn’t know it existed. Only a very short walk to many attractions (Times Square, Fifth Ave, not to far north to Central Park) and plenty of subway stops around making almost any destination on Manhattan very easily reachable. The reception is not behind a desk, but out in the open, with the staff very friendly and accommodating of your needs. The rooms are very modern and comfortable…yes they are small, but this is NY and you’re not there to spend all day in your room. I like how you can refill some of the basic supplies yourself from the closet located on each floor. And the free water bottles are a nice bonus. Oh, free WIFI. It has a business centre with PCs, a printer and a nice quiet lounge area (with phone charges for almost every possible model). The gym has some good equipment, and there is a washing machine and dryer free for guest use (only one so get in early or late). A few minor housekeeping issues when I was there (they were forgetful with some items) but to sum up this is the best hotel I’ve stayed at (relative to the location and my expectation).

"Hotel union was fine, i wouldn't pay too much to stay there though. The front desk asked if we'ed like to stay on the street side or not, we chose street even though they warned us of the noise.
However, as the wife and I are no strangers to the noise on busy streets, it wasn't the nite life that keep you awake. It's the sanitation that's the problem! we stayed for 6 nites and two of them were sooooooooo noisy that i could not even sleep. All nite bang bang bang. lifting the bins and Slamming them down up and down the street. That was a tuesday, it could've stopped around 3 or 4. Then Thursday came, BANG BANG BANG even louder this time, who knows maybe the bins were bigger or made of steel. BANG BANG BANG and just when you though it was over DING DING DING the cable cars are in action. OMG.
we booked a nice place to stay in Napa just to get some sleep. We couyld've made it a day trip but as i said i was REALLY tired at this point.
So all in all, the boutique was nice enough, we didn't have the problems of small rooms that I had read in some reviews(they are small) but when they ask if you want to stay on street side, do yourself a fav and say NO thanks.
Otherwise location was great and no other real complaints.",negative,en
"As a business traveler I am in a hotel about 40 weeks of the year and build my rating of a hotel on the numerous chains and locations that I frequent. I stayed at the Westin Galleria Hotel in Dallas 20+ days over a four week period to find it to be average. The location is perfect for the mall, and number of restaurants in the area but the hotel does not jump out or provide anything to make the stay special. The rooms are dated with older furnishings in some rooms that show many years of wear. The highway side of the hotel provides a dull roar of traffic 24-7 but the back side overlooking the mall is much better. There are two restaurants in the hotel; one that is part of the hotel and the other is leasing space. Both of the restaurants are overpriced for the food quality and quantity received. For the money, Del Frisco's Steak House is much better quality food in a better atmosphere.
Some of my frustration with the hotel is with the staff that did not appear to be knowledgeable about the hotel, how to handle any special requests, and how to extend the check out date on your stay. On my second trip to the hotel, I requested a room away from the highway, as the sleepless week before was not good, only to be given a room facing the highway that had been smoked in without proper cleaning. That same trip I requested information about a promotion that SPG was providing only to find that 3 out of the 4 people at the front desk did not know anything about the promotion and made no attempt to find out any information. On my third trip, I needed to stay over the weekend and an extra week and called down to make the arrangement which were to be taken care of but the end of the first week I received my bill under the door which is typical on you last day only to find the staff had not made the changes and were expecting me to leave per my first reservation. The issues with the staff lie with the management’s responsibility to properly train the staff before allowing them to interact with customers.
The second issue I have with the Westin Galleria is the lack of services provided and the excessive fees for any service that is provided. There was a $12 fee for the delivery of a UPS package to my room (in which I tipped the delivery person $5 not knowing I was being charged $12 for the delivery), and $2 charge for a call to SPG to ask about a promotion at the hotel.
If you are in Dallas for shopping at the Galleria, the hotel is in the perfect location and the euphoria of shopping may help overcome the short-comings of the hotel and staff.",negative,en

"Une histoire tendre et drôle sur la rencontre improbable entre un artiste des rues et une petite fille abandonnée, livrés à eux-mêmes dans un monde désenchanté. Charles Lane II a su capter l’aura d’une New-York contemporaine et authentique dans une œuvre intemporelle et unique dont les magnifiques images en noir et blanc accrochent immédiatement le regard du spectateur, et dont la musique étonnamment moderne et variée signée Marc Marder se fait le dialogue subtil et adéquat. Dans cet hommage à Chaplin, l’alchimie entre l’artiste et la petite fille est évidente de sincérité puisqu’ils sont père et fille dans la vie.

"If you enjoy attention to detail, then you will either love or hate the Grand Hyatt Riverwalk. If you enjoy finding unfinished craftsmanship and shoddy workmanship everywhere then you could spend a lifetime in the hotel.
The entire hotel gives you the feel of being rushed together, being that it wasn’t ready for the 2008 Final Four and there are stories of rooms being furnished after people were checked in, there may be more truth than speculation in that statement. If you are like me and are bothered by shoddy and apathetic workmanship then steering clear of this disaster is probably the best medicine. If taking a tour of the ballrooms gives you any indication of how rushed and how little care was taken into the construction of this hotel, I’m not quite sure I feel safe walking down the halls, let alone bringing a conference of people in with me. Airwalls and airwall doors that resemble buck teeth and close just as well, carpet coming up from the edges, holes sawed into the ballroom columns that house the thermometers that look like they were sawed with butter knives, closed fire exits with paper signs leading victims, I mean guests, down hundred foot corridors, lights that don’t exactly fit correctly and hang out from the ceiling, patch panels that in one room were hanging two inches out from the wall and not secured, room capacity signs held on with tape, wall paper cut poorly, everywhere you look you can quickly find 10 things that were finished poorly or not finished at all. The hotel looks as if the finishing touches were applied with a stopwatch, again, probably not too far from the truth. A feel of “I’ll finish it later, we just need to get this done,” is applied to seemingly all surroundings. I picture a mass of unskilled workers just slapping carpet down, and slopping tile and wallpaper on in seconds, slicing and tacking with no regard to the final product.
There are three glaring examples of poor planning. The first is that inside the ballroom are large viewing rooms overlooking the area. These openings are probably 2 foot by 15 feet and there are 4 total. Now this in itself wouldn’t be too bad even despite the fact that you can see the black girders and skeleton of the hotel, the poor planning part is that for some unknown reason the hotel has placed the AV office inside one of these areas. This gives all of your guests a nice helping of the entire daily goings on inside the office because the overhead opening acts as a speaker amplifying the sound across the room. You can hear all of the requirements of the next several shows that have made the unfortunate selection of this hotel for their conference. This isn’t to say these people are being loud, just a regular conversational tone resonates throughout from this crow’s nest. On a parallel thought, the ballrooms could resonate the worst echoes this side of the Grand Canyon. The sound system is probably adequate, but there is no sound system devised that could square off with the echo in this room making all speakers unintelligible. All conversation reinforced with speakers or not, must fight through this almost visible sound fog to get to their intended target. That unfortunately is not the second glaring example of poor planning; the second are the wall sconces. The wall sconces are more or less lights with what appear to be the remnants of what I recall were what hippies used to hang from their doors. That’s all fine and good; the unfortunate part is that they are surrounded by a shiny silver rectangle cage that sticks out about a foot from the wall. Again, in itself it doesn’t pose a problem nor does it look bad, the problem is that the geniuses who placed these on the wall placed the bottom of these cages at around 5 foot off the ground, putting the nice, hard, sharp corners at about the average person’s chin height. Being that the walls and the flowing beads also make nice camouflage for this cage/bruise maker, you will have several attendees enjoy a good ol’ fashioned head crack as they look to find their seat not paying attention to the booby traps so nicely placed for their convenience. The third is a little surprise for anyone interested in a nice afternoon workout. The workout facility is bountifully filled with equipment, free weights, workout machines, treadmills, bikes and elipticals that fill both rooms, and all for free and open 24 hours. The cardio room is situated with a beautiful view overlooking the city. It is one of the nicest around, and all for free. The downside is this, all of the treadmills, elliptical machines and stationary bikes have a wonderful view of the city, I can understand why they are put in this arrangement, but and it’s a big but, they all face west. Can anyone foresee the problem? Facing west means that during the period from sunup to sundown using these machines mean you will be facing the San Antonio sun for your entire workout without any shade provided. I’m not sure why the two rooms were not switched, because while doing a free weight/universal machine workout you have the opportunity to walk away and get away from the sun for a short period, doing a cario workout gives you not respite.
I would call the interior of the hotel a nice 20 footer. From 20 feet most of the walls and carpet look nice, it’s upon further inspection that you begin to notice the glaring oversights of workmanship. I can’t believe anyone from the Hyatt green lighted the opening of the hotel stands almost defiantly not up to what I consider Hyatt’s standards. The workmanship is what I would expect from a low budget hotel, probably somewhere with the remote secured on top of a table, not of a hotel that has just opened up. I kept feeling that the hotel was planning on shutting down for like 6 months to finish sometime in the future and that they were just trying to get through this period until they could actually do everything right. Being a slight perfectionist it was impossible to not walk around unnerved by the poor construction and attention to detail. Also, being that the Hyatt is a short walk from the Alamo and the Riverwalk I would probably either consider using the convention center and staying in another hotel or using another hotel all together.",negative,en
"This was the best find ever for a few reasons! My background is in luxury hotels and spas, so I've been to and had my share of spa treatments and facilities. At the end of the day there is ONE reason why people go back to the same aesthetician or massage therapist over and over, its SERVICE! Dale is, yes, a male and for those of you with the fear of \""I'm too afraid to have a male wax down there\"", you'd be making a huge mistake. Not all aestheticians are created equal unfortunately. In the past with other providers there have been challenges with pain and scarring when getting waxed. When I leave the studio, I have the best education on after care, products to use, and pain free. Dale's studio offers a wide variety of services, he just so happens to be my go-to-guy for Brazilians. Extremely polished, professional, educated and has a great sense of humor.\n\nDale is someone who is passionate and successful in anything he does.

"Just a few blocks from the subway on 34th St and walking distance to most of the sights via 5th and 6th Ave, so it's pretty slap-bang in the middle of town. Certainly a lot cheaper (and more spacious) and better value for what you get than what the Hilton Garden Inn (on 35th) were asking for when we stayed in 2009.
All the staff at the hotel are very helpful and friendly from the moment you walk in through the door. Housekeeping is very good; the rooms are really clean and neutral in colour, and the hotel has done away with the old-fashioned practice of giving you a tag to put on the outside door handle (instead, there is a green light and a red light next to your door number which you set from inside). We stayed in an executive room: a nice and clean king size bed, with a sofa and armchair/footrest. In-room alarm clock/radio thing, with iPod dock, which is great for charging your iPhone or any other compatible device if you've forgot your cables/chargers. The hotel also keeps a large stock of travel adaptors at reception desk if you need one, which you can use for free throughout your stay. Bathroom has a roomy, clean shower and plenty of linen, though it was a bit dark in there even with all the lights on. TV has quite a few channels if you do plan to watch it. Housekeeping also do laundry for a reasonable fee, which is great if you need a couple of shirts or dresses cleaned or pressed for an evening out – they offer a same day service for no extra fee, provided you give them a call by 0900hrs.
Free Wi-Fi for as many devices as you want (they'll give you the password at check-in, but in-case they don't, just ask), which is always good, especially for booking some tickets for attractions in advance – the business centre down in the lower lobby has a printer, so you can print things off when you need it for no charge. There's also a cash machine / ATM in the business centre if you need it – I'm not sure if it charges a fee, but it's good to know it's there if you need it.
There are two small lifts serving the hotel, but expect to wait ages if you want to go downstairs in the evening – every woman, man and his dog will be going up to the roof for the rooftop bar (I don't blame them) and it's open to hotel guests as well as the general public, so the lifts don't require you to swipe your keycard in order to operate it.
Unfortunately however, there is a large amount of building work taking place next door, so expect to feel like an earthquake is taking place at around 0800hrs every day of the the week except for Sunday. I wasn't too fussed as it was a wake-up call for us, but I would've appreciated a lie-in on the Monday. And a warning about the mini-bar: Unless you plan to have something, leave the thing well alone! The fridge and the tray are rigged to sensors, so the minute you decide to open a flap or pick up an item on the tray, it gets charged to the room. So if you've got kids, tell them not to fiddle with it!
Would definitely stay again, even if there are still building works next door!",positive,en

"Only a handful of the segments are engaging here. A segment with a garage attendant from Nigeria is heartbreaking. One with Fanny Ardent & Bob Hoskins makes its point, twist by twist until the final shot overplays things. The problem with this movie is that only a few of the clips invoke Paris. The others are so scatter-shot in theme, tone, volition & production that you may as well be watching ""The Years Best Commercials, 2006."" It's really all over the place. It doesn't develop over it's running time, and nothing reigns the directors in. No construct successfully joins the pieces... tedium sets in. I'm at the one hour, twenty minute point and Elijah Wood is in some dumb, over-commercial, overproduced vampire shtick. It has about as much to do with Paris as old ladies knitting in the Antartic. Fantasy shows up I think first in the Coen Brothers segment (Uh, thanks J & E for ruining another movie) and then makes way too many appearances. The point of being in Paris is that you don't need make-believe crap to make your days extraordinary. Why divide it by neighborhood if Quartier de la Madeleine is equated with vampires for some loser director? Has there ever been a genre more over-represented than the vampire film. Every three years we get the same lame vampire clichés.Making things worse is that the switch from segment to segment is pretty artless. The transitions get lost. This doesn't feel intentional, it feels sloppy.",negative,en

"6 days before we left home I called and asked about the airport shuttle. I was told to call when I had my luggage. I said I would have 3 large suitcases, they said no problem. So I called when we had our luggage, I was told the shuttle would be at the airport in 15 minutes. We waited an hour and 3 phone calls. The shuttle driver was mad that I had suitcases. The van was a beater 15 passenger with no luggage space. I told him the cases were heavy and I would help him load them. I ended up loading them my self. It appeared to me the front desk people had no control over the shuttle. Perhaps it is a contract that needs to be cancelled.
The front desk people were very helpful with questions about nearby stores and restaurants.
Our room was typical hotel clean. Sheets and towels were fine. The room needed a deep cleaning. The carpet had ground in dirt, the chair and desk are way past replacement time.
The next day we took a shuttle to the cruise ship terminal. We had a female driver who was great. She was a driver, loader, tour guide, great attitude person.

"Stayed at Hudson Hotel for 4 nights new years with my partner. It definetley is style over substance and more concern is given to non guests who come in to use the bar/nightclub.
Most of the staff are unwelcoming, from the ""think im famous doormen"" to the ""im too good to speak to you reception staff"". However there were a few staff members who asissted us and were polite .I think a reality check is required afterall it is the return visitors that keep this place afloat.
The rooms are small dark non existent storage, not enough room for two people to navigate around but i didnt spend much in them too many places to go. The bathrooms are tiny but adeqaute to shower in. There is a see through window seperating the bathroom from the sleeping area just pull the curtain over for privacy. The room was freezing all through our stay and despite reporting this it took repeated complaints from me for anyone to address this. Its bizarre but the public areas are boiling hot all the time. The public areas are nice and Location is good close to Columbus but thats the best point.
The Hudson is stylish, unique and has some nice touches. It is overpriced for what it delivers which is why i would not return here again. I have stayed at hotels with fewer stars that have delivered a better service and prioritise their guests.

"I have stayed there for just one night on last monday. Radisson Hotel is the closest hotel to Los Angeles Airport and it takes just 2-3 minutes to go there by car and 10 minutes on feet. The room was big and the bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was enormously big I have never seen a bathroom on that size before. I think the windows were shut down by the hotel to cut heavy noise or security reasons so it is impossible to have fresh air when you need it. The air condition was working too noisy that it is not acceptable if you are staying at a 4 star world brand hotel and the hotel was not offered free breakfast , business center and car park. I do not know why a 4 star hotel do not offer free breakfast ,business center,and car park even they could able to offer. You can use the internet free at the room if you have a laptop if not you can use p.c using your credit card at the lobby in a 4 star hotel !!!! The policies of the hotel is so weird.

"This is a small property as far as casinos go (like Palms, Main Street Station, California). But there is a large parking lot and it's also attached to Bass Pros Shop (an aquarium and many stuffed animal displays throughout the two-level store/attraction). This is what sets this casino apart from others. In addition to the aquariums inside (Mermaid Bar?), there is a huge one, with small sharks and rays along with fish, and if you're lucky enough to see the feeding, it's pretty cool (I could stare at aquariums and sea life for a long time). The last time we came to this property it was christmas time ('11), and there were quite a few people here- lots of families. \n\nThe property has undergone a big transformation in recent years (my husband said that it looked totally different since he's worked here and that a restaurant was moved or eliminated; then it was called Boom Town). A few years ago, my brother and his family stayed here because there was a special promotion going on for nearby residents, and their room was really very nice! Since it's a newer property, the furniture was more modern and contemporary rather than tired, outdated or kitschy.",neutral,en

"As I start all reviews, please take a look and see how many hotels I've reviewed, I'm not a jaded one time traveler. I travel often and feel I have a good base to write a good overall review. I'd also like to say I love Fairmont Hotels, I've stayed in several and do prefer them to other 5 star properties (Usually) Before my stay I checked the TA reviews as I often do and was surprised by the amount of negative reviews. But I do take negative reviews with a grain of salt of the person writing the review has only written one review. This stay at Fairmont Chicago was surprising to say the very least. Upon arrival the valet was very prompt taking our luggage and parking our car. The lobby is really outstanding, it's very new and modern. The service was lacking, usually if you are a Presidents Club - Premier you're really rolled out the red carpet. This did not happen, honestly the man checking us in didn't even acknowledge it. At no point did he ask of we would like to upgrade to Gold or if we wanted any reservations for dinner or the spa. The elevators are quick (which I love) We booked a ""Parkview Suite"" on the 34th floor.
The room was HUGE (living, dining, separate bedroom and large bath) as stated in other reviews the rooms are missing something. I don't know if it was because it was a suite but the room had a cold empty feel. The room did have the usual great bedding and comfortable bed in room coffee full mini bar. It appears that when the last renovation took place it was done quickly and no attention to detail. The paint was chipping in several areas, the bathroom door was out and out dirty the sprinkler head in the bathroom was falling out of the ceiling the pocket door for the water closet did not close. The bath did have an updated sink, mirror, tile and shower which were very nice and on par with other Fairmonts. Another huge disappointment was the lack of plugs and odd places for the light switches. In the bedroom there were two useable plugs and they were across the room one behind a heavy bench the other under the window so if you wanted to charge your phone by the bed you couldn't. Our room was right next to the elevators and unlike other reviews we had no issue, it just sounded like the wind blowing (and they don't have a bell that dings)
As a Presidents club member their workout gear is usually waiting in the room again that was not the case, turndown service was sporadic of the 4 nights only turned down twice. ( I can close my own drapes but if you're going to do it be consistent) During the times we were turned down we received bottled water and a piece of paper with the next days forecast (at other locations these are nicely printed, here is was a very old copy of a copy with the info hand written)
My biggest point of frustration was we decided to add a day to our stay. This in my opinion should not be complicated, yet the front desk seemed as if it was the biggest request ever made. First we were told sure that wouldn't be a problem, then received a call that our current suite was booked and would have to move to a standard room we said fine, then we were told we could stay in the room and then another call to see if we were checking out and then received a voicemail stating we wouldn't have to change rooms. To me it appears as if the right hand isnt speaking to the left. On top of all that once we returned to the hotel at 8pm we reached our room on the 34th floor to find our keys didn't work. We then got to stand in a line for 15 minutes so we could get our keys re-activated.
At all the other Fairmonts I've stayed I like to view our Guest Folio via the tv. This location does not offer the option. The concierge was great, was able to give great transportation tips and suggest good restaurants. (Shaws Crab House, Gaylord Indian)
The hotel restarant for dinner was OUTSTANDING, the food, service and even the decor excellent. It is really top notch and again on par with other Fairmonts. Sadly the breakfast was a total joke. Im sorry but $16 bucks for 2 eggs is a joke. They may claim that the pricing is comparable with other hotels but I still think to price gouge your customers who just paid for hotel room with you is not right.
We do have some great tips, the hotel does not make you aware but they are connected with the Chicago pedway system. You can walk from the hotel all the way to Macys State Street (aka Marshall Fields) without setting foot outside. It is a little confusing and poorly marked but sooooo convenient with the harsh Chicago winters. After seeing the breakfast prices at the hotel we were able to take the pedway to ""Wildberry"" the breakfast is truly EXCELLENT (ate there all 4 days), everything is fresh and the prices are in line with what they should be. As stated the pedway came in handy, you can also take it to the train station and a mall on State Street. Granted if you look at a map they are only a block or two from Michigan Ave, but to get to the good shopping you must take a taxi or bus. You can walk to State street for shopping but Mich Ave is far better.
Overall would I recommend this hotel? No. This is a nice hotel but does not live up to Fairmont high standards I've received at the other properties. I would have felt very cheated and most likely addressed these issues with the manager if I'd paid full price but they offered a good winter deal.. For the price I'd as you can read in my other reviews recommend the Four Seasons or Ritz if for a 4 star I'd go with the Intercontinental. Those are are very central and very high quality. If you have a chance to ever stay with Fairmont from my past travels I'd recommend them 100% (except this one)
Happy Travels! Cheers!",positive,en

"Redeemed my Groupon here today. The restaurant wasn't busy when I arrived around 8pm, and they waited patiently for me to review their menu (first time visitor) and finally placed my order. With the Groupon $12 credit, I only paid another $3 for a large Chicken Bowl Combo and a Chicken Wrap (all upgraded with Brown Rice and the rice bowl topped with their Spicy Sauce). But there were a steady flow of customers that came and went during my meal, mostly ordering take-outs.\n\nThe portions served here are decent, especially the wrap/burrito. And it was pretty good, except I thought it could be \""enhanced\"" with more teriyaki sauce (packed with a lot of brown rice which makes the whole mouthful of chicken wrap tastes dry). The Chicken Bowl is pretty much the same thing, except obviously served in a bowl and I liked the spicy upgraded version of the sauce.\n\nPrice-wise, it seems like a lot. But with the healthy portion size that will leave you satisfied, I think it was A-OK.\n\nThe restaurant is decorated with Samurai Sam motif wall paper, with Kanji characters, origami instructions, etc. decorating one side of the wall. I thought it was pretty neat. It is furnished with small tables and chairs that are typical of these fast-casual chain restaurants, which are comfortable to use during your meal, but not comfy enough to spend a lazy afternoon chilling or reading your book.\n\nThe service is surprisingly fast. My order was complete just a minute or two after I filled my cup with sodas and started to read a library book I had brought with me.\n\nThey also have a promotion of 10% off for LVAV members with a current ID, which at least one lady (she was cute and besides myself, might just be the best looking person to drop by the entire time I was there :p ) took advantaged of. \n\nOverall, it is a nice little take-out or dine-in fast casual restaurant serving teriyaki themed menu. If I am in the area and in the mood for teriyaki chicken or steak, I would drop by. Heard their teriyake salmon is good, so maybe I will try that in the future.\n\nAmbiance: 3.5/5\n\nCleanliness: 4.5/5\n\nFood: 3/5 Not gourmet, but hits the spot when you crave some teriyaki.\n\nService: 3.5/5 Fast service!\n\nPrice: 3/5 You get what you pay for.\n\nLocation: SW part of town, and not close to the Strip, so definitely for locals working, residing in the area.\n\nParking: 4/5 Plenty of parking 90% of the time.\n\nA-OK!",negative,en

"Una maravilla
La verdad es que tenía muchas dudas sobre los objetivos todoterreno, porque he leído en muchas webs que estos objetivos no sacan buena calidad, pero me he sorprendido gratamente. Enfoque rápido y silencioso, gran versatilidad, excelente nitidez y calidad en las fotografías. No puedo compararlo con objetivos fijos, pero puedo asegurar que saca incluso más calidad que los objetivos de kit de nikon. Tenía el 18-55 y el 55-200 de nikon, y con este tengo todo en uno. Incluso en interiores con poca luz he conseguido sacar buenas fotos. Cierto que distorsiona un poco en focales cortas (18 mm), pero el 18-55 de nikon también lo hacía. Excelente relación calidad-precio. Lo recomiendo 100%.",positive,es

"There are only a handful of places to eat which are still open at Scottsdale Fashion Square after a movie lets out. If you're not looking to drive/walk anywhere else, Kona Grill may do. \n\nIt was a nice evening and we were able to easily find seating on their outdoor patio. While it overlooks the street leading to the parking lot, it's OK. Having the misters on was cooling, but I have a pet peeve about mister water getting into my drinks and/or food. Who knows where that water has been?!?! While the tables and chairs were comfortable, the noise level was through the roof (and this is coming from someone who enjoys a boisterous setting!) Between the cars, a birthday celebration and the music, I could barely hear my friend sitting about two feet away. \n\nWe stopped in for a quick drink and a few apps to share. We had the California Roll (fresh!), the Potstickers (good wonton prep but undescernable filling) and the Margherita Flatbread (yummy, but a little on the sweet side with the Balsamic drizzle.) My friend's beer was cold and crisp. My Ladies Margarita was almost too alcoholic. (Proportion, people!!!) The food portion sizes were adequate and the Reverse Happy Hour prices were attractive.\n\nOur server was pleasant and attentive. *HE* seemed amiable enough, but I felt like I was just a number and here's why. Before the evening was over, another man in a shirt and tie who didn't identify himself asked if everything was ok and disappeared before I could finish my reply. Total time spent at the table: less than two seconds. This has \""manager completing his required stop\"" all over it. There was nothing genuine about his concern, other than it seemed he got \""points\"" from his employer for having asked the question. This small act can have a lasting impression. It did. Just wasn't a good one.",negative,en
"This hotel must have been a very nice place when new, or newer. It now needs more care than it is getting. More on that later. First the positives. It is well located for downtown activities such as Michigan Ave, the Navey Peer, Millennium Park and down town businesses. I had a standard room with a king bed. The room was large by hotel standards. There was mini fridge, but it was stuffed with liquer, beer and pops. One nice touch was a sofa by the window. I was on the 35th floor and the views of the Chicago skyline were amazing. The staff was very courteous and helpful. I stayed at the Fairmont because there was a conference there. The conference facilities are nice and once again the staff was outstanding, in particular George. Thank you George for your kind words.
I only had room service once, and the Chicago style pizza was as good as it gets.
A few negatives that move this from a 4 star to a 3 star in my book. The paint on the room door was pealing and dirty. The inside corners of most surfaces were dirty. If you are a neat freak this might bother you, if not no big deal. The doors do bang shut, so bring ear plugs.
If you join the Presidents Club (free to do so) you get wireless Internet free of charge. You can join online at their website.
Overall, this is a good place. I do not know what their regular rates are, but we paid $149 per night. That seems like a good deal for downtown Chicago.",negative,en
"As stated by other reviewers, the lobby has been updated but the culture shock begins when you exit the elevator at your floor. Sad can be the only description. We had booked a Combo Suite and received an email before we arrived asking if we would like an upgrade. Of course we said yes. My 26yr old son wanted to know if this was an upgrade, what was the size of the room we would have got before. I explained that this is NYC and unless you pay lots and go for something a lot newer, this is what you get. I didn't mind the size of the two rooms. With three of us the fold-out bed was used and we had to ask for more blankets in order to make this a little more comfortable. The hotel was great and gave us a fridge and we bought a kettle so we were able to have tea/coffee/breakfast in our room. What was a shock was the size of the bathroom. It was possible to sit on the toilet and have a wash in the basin at the same time. To climb into the bathtub needed clever manipulation. I can't say for sure but I think the floor probably wasn't vacuumed in all the time we were there. I was there a number of times when the room was serviced and it seemed a very rough and ready clean. Would I stay again? I'm not sure. However, it really is well situated for everything on Manhattan. The staff (doormen, front desk, security) are very good. The Edison Cafe is good value and the deli beside the hotel came in very handy a lot of times. Hopefully, plans are to update all the floors. Once again, would I stay again? Based on what I have just said I probably would.",neutral,en

"Todai, Todai - well, this was not to die for, that's for sure. Wish I had read the Yelp reviews before going here instead of while eating here! That will teach me, but so it goes.\n\nHowever, needing to satisfy that raw fish urge that follows me everywhere I go now, we decided to eat here one evening while our carnivore friends did something else. Besides, we had a 10% off coupon and it was within walking distance. Sometimes that's how the choices are made.\n\nI was so excited! A seafood and sushi buffet! I just couldn't imagine what all-you-can-eat of my favorite things was going to be like. I thought it would be amazing for sure.\n\nThere were plenty of things I could've loved here. Unfortunately, no way to possibly try it all. I pretty much settled on sushi alone, and then added some tempura prawns and veggies towards the end.\n\nThe sushi was \""ok.\"" So, now I'm becoming a connoisseur I see and can actually tell the difference! Ok, so perhaps this experience was a good thing. There was nothing wrong with it - it just didn't have the same wonderful wow factor that other sushi has given me. But, I persevered and tried almost everything they had set out. The nigiri was better than their rolls and got snapped up quickly by the predominantly Asian clientele dining here. The tempura I had later on looked fabulous but did not really deliver in taste.\n\nHad I not just been to an all-you-can-eat crab fest last month, I'm sure I would've enjoyed the piles of Snow Crab legs served here, but I skipped those. Tons of other offerings, but little me just wanted raw and I can't consume much, so I didn't try the other choices of Korean BBQ, 3 kinds of soups, stir fry, and lots of cooked fishies. Desserts looked great and Larry had a plate full of those.\n\nService was fast and friendly with our waitress coming by constantly to keep my teacup full and clearing plates.\n\nIn the end, I felt the price had been somewhat high for the quality (around $28 per person to dine here with the discount) and then later on when I was back in our room, I found a 20% off coupon in the hotel magazine. Damn! Wouldn't have made much difference of course, but I hate it when that happens. \n\nI probably would try a different place the next time as I saw other sushi buffets mentioned that sounded better. I'd give 3 stars here but I just felt the price for quality wouldn't justify that.",negative,en

"To start with the positives.. The location was perfect, a mere ten minute walk at the most from grand central station and only one block away from the top end of 5th avenue (New Yorks main shopping location for those that haven't yet been). Check in was swift and our bags were taken to our rooms. The room was very small and warm with no way to cool it down except open the window, which opened out onto the middle of the hotel with a view of nothing but the restaraunt vents and the inside 4 wall structure of the hotel, but we didn't see this as a major issue as our trip was to get out and about, not spend all our time in the room.
The first night we slept ok, however, when we woke and turned on the room lights, it became apparant that we were not the only things in the room, we had been sharing the bed with a ""BED BUG"" as well as being overlooked by a few other bugs crawling over the walls. My partner took a picture on her phone as proof and when heading out for the day, we bought it to the attention of the reception staff. The lady was very abrupt and was not very helpful, when we mentioned what we found, she took us for liars, even after seeing the picture of proof, it seemed like she was in serious denial. Nonetheless, we were alocated a different room which was much more spacious and had a much better view so this was most definatly a plus point.
There are no safes provided within the rooms however hotel guests can sign out a ""lock box"" down in the reception area which is more than adequate to store things like passports and any loose money you do not wish to carry about with you. We stored our suitcase away in the cupboard we had in our room, along with my partners handbag which was zipped away within my case and my coat which was hung up on the rail.
Unfortunately we had a slight issue with our TV so when we left for a 2nd time, we reported this and were assured it would be rectified by the time we returned.
On returning from a day of shopping, I went into the cupboard to grab something from my case and immediately noticed that something wasn't right. Upon inspection, we noticed that our English money (notes only) had been taken, this was a rough value of around $40 us dollars. Upon reporting this to the hotel reception, nobody seemed the slightest bit interested and no apology or remorse was given/shown. Due to this fact, I demanded the hotel contact the local police so it could be reported to the correct authorities to give me the feeling something would actually get done about this matter. A statement was taken and We were told it would be handed to the hotel's manager the following morning for investigation.
To this date (Jan 11) I have still recieved no contact from the hotel as to what actions were taken, if any.
Another caution for guests is to be very aware of storing your cases once you have checked out. You get given a ticket allocating which case is yours, however, that is neither use nor ornament as my partners sisters cases were sent to the airport with other people to which the porters found highly amusing!!

"This is a value priced hotel and that's what you get. Very convenient to 1-10--less than a minute away. The neighborhood is best described as ""seedy"" and a number of homeless people and transients are close by at night. When we first arrived at about 11PM, the doors were locked and we had to bang on the window to have someone let us in--this took 4-5 minutes with some ""concerning"" people close to us. I'm a big city guy, and even I wasn't very confortable in the parking lot after dark. The access road was in very poor condition with dangerous suspension-crushing potholes.
The facility itself is OK. Clean, nice common areas. Rooms are small (no big deal) and are about what expect you'd expect at this price point. However, the lighting in the rooms is dim and inadequate, which made our room look like a prison cell when we arrived late. Much better in the morning. Two major issues: there is no continental breakfast--just coffee. So if you want to get something light to eat (bagel, pastry) you have to walk to a convenience store a block away--a real annoyance. There is no public computer or printer, so if you don't go through the hassle of bringing your own, you're stuck. The front desk will print a boarding pass if you give them the confirmation number (when they get around to it) but you can't check email if you don't have your confirmation number so there's no other way to print--my friend had to check in at the airport.
Staff was OK--nothing special and a few a little unpleasant. They tried to stick on that ""safe fee"" even after told them to remove it.
Know what you're getting (and not getting) and it's marginally OK for travelers on a budget.",positive,en
